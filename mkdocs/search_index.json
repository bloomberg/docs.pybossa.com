You can get your API-KEY in your \nprofile\n account.\n\n\nThe returned objects will have a \nlinks\n and \nlink\n fields, not\nincluded in the model in order to support \nHypermedia as the Engine of\nApplication State\n (also known as\nHATEOAS), so you can know which are the relations between objects.\n\n\nAll objects will return a field \nlink\n which will be the absolute URL\nfor that specific object within the API. If the object has some parents,\nyou will find the relations in the \nlinks\n list.

The \ntitle\n field is\nused to specify the type of the object: task, taskrun or project.\n\n\nProjects will not have a \nlinks\n field, because these objects do not\nhave parents.\n\n\nTasks will have only one parent: the associated project.\n\n\nTask Runs will have only two parents: the associated task and associated\nproject.\n\n\nRate Limiting\n\n\nRate Limiting has been enabled for all the API endpoints (since PYBOSSA\nv2.0.1). The rate limiting gives any user, using the IP, \na window of\n15 minutes to do at most 300 requests per endpoint\n.\n\n\nThis new feature includes in the headers the following values to\nthrottle your requests without problems:\n\n\n\n\nX-RateLimit-Limit\n: the rate limit ceiling for that given request\n\n\nX-RateLimit-Remaining\n: the number of requests left for the 15\n    minute window\n\n\nX-RateLimit-Reset\n: the remaining window before the rate limit\n    resets in UTC epoch seconds\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend to use the Python package \nrequests\n for interacting with\nPYBOSSA, as it is really simple to check those values:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nimport\n \nrequests\n\n\nimport\n \ntime\n\n\n\nres\n \n=\n \nrequests\n.\nget\n(\nhttp://SERVER/api/project\n)\n\n\nif\n \nint\n(\nres\n.\nheaders\n[\nX-RateLimit-Remaining\n])\n \n \n10\n:\n\n    \ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n300\n)\n \n# Sleep for 5 minutes\n\n\nelse\n:\n\n    \npass\n \n# Do your stuff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList\n\n\nList domain objects:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{domain-object}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe API is context aware in the sense that if you\nve an API-KEY and\nyou\nre authenticating the calls, then, the server will send you first\nyour own related data: projects, tasks, and task runs. You can get\naccess to all the projects, tasks, and task runs (the whole data base)\nusing the parameter: \nall=1\n.\n\n\nFor example, if an anonymous user access the generic api endpoints like:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will return all the projects from the DB, ordering them by ID. If you\naccess it like authenticating yourself:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project?api_key=YOURKEY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you will get your own list of projects. In other words, the\nprojects that you own. If you don\nt have a project, but you want to\nexplore the API then you can use the \nall=1\n argument:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project?api_key=YOURKEY\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis call will return all the projects from the DB ordering by ID.\n\n\nFor example, you can get a list of your Projects like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project?api_key=YOURKEY\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project?api_key=YOURKEY\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr a list of available Categories:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/category\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr a list of Tasks:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?api_key=YOURKEY\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?api_key=YOURKEY\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a list of TaskRuns use:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun?api_key=YOURKEY\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun?api_key=YOURKEY\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you can get a list of users by doing:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/user\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of project of project IDs\n\n\nIn PYBOSSA most of the domain objects are related to a project.\nTherefore, you can query (or filter) a list of project IDs directly via\nthe API to reduce the number of queries that you need to do. This is\nspecially useful for Single Page Applications that only use the PYBOSSA\nJSON endpoints.\n\n\nFor example, you can get all the tasks for a list of projects like this:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?project_id=[1,2,3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat filter will return tasks for project IDs 1, 2 and 3. The same can\nbe done for task runs and blogposts.\n\n\nCreated\n\n\nIf you want, you can use the the domain attribute \ncreated\n to get items\nfrom the DB. Basically, you can specify a year, year-month,\nyear-month-day to get all the values for those ranges. For example, if\nyou want all the tasks that have been created in 2015, just use:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?created=2015\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want all the task runs from 2015-05:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun?created=2015-05\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can for example get all the task runs that a user has submitted on a\ngiven day like this:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun?created=2015-05-03\nuser_id=3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis filter works for any object that has the \ncreated\n attribute.\n\n\nOrder by\n\n\nAny query can be ordered by an attribute of the domain object that you\nare querying. For example you can get a list of tasks ordered by ID:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?orderby=id\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want, you can order them in descending order:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?orderby=id\ndesc=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck all the attributes that you can use to order by in the \nDomain\nObject section\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease, notice that in order to keep users privacy, only their locale and\nnickname will be shared by default. Optionally, users can disable\nprivacy mode in their settings. By doing so, also their fullname and\naccount creation date will be visible for everyone through the API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA limits the list of items to 20. If you want to get more\nitems, use the keyword \nlimit=N\n with \nN\n being a number to get\nthat amount. There is a maximum of 100 to the \nlimit\n keyword, so\nif you try to get more items at once it won\nt work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nDEPRECATED (see next Note for a better and faster solution)\n\nYou can use the keyword \noffset=N\n in any \nGET\n query to skip\nthat many rows before beginning to get rows. If both \noffset\n and\n\nlimit\n appear, then \noffset\n rows are skipped before starting\nto count the \nlimit\n rows that are returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can paginate the results of any GET query using the last ID of the\ndomain object that you have received and the parameter:\n\nlast_id\n. For example, to get the next 20 items after the last\nproject ID that you\nve received you will write the query like this:\n\nGET /api/project?last\\_id={{last\\_id}}\n.\n\n\n\n\nRelated data\n\n\nFor Tasks, TaskRuns and Results you can get the associated data using\nthe argument: \nrelated=True\n.\n\n\nThis flag will allow you to get in one call all the TaskRuns and Result\nfor a given task. You can do the same for a TaskRun getting the Task and\nassociated Result, and for a Result getting all the task_runs and\nassociated Task.\n\n\nProjects do not have this feature, as it will be too expensive for the\nAPI.\n\n\nGet\n\n\nGet a specific domain object by id (by default any GET action will\nreturn only 20 objects, you can get more or less objects using the\n\nlimit\n option).

For searching like that all you have to do\nis adding the following argument:\n\n\n1\ninfo=key1::value1\nfulltextsearch=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat will return every object in the DB that has a key equal to key1 and\ncontains in the value the word value1.\n\n\nAnother option could be the following:\n\n\n1\ninfo=key1::value1|key2:word1%26word2\nfulltextsearch=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis second query will return objects that has the words word1 and\nword2. It\ns important to escape the \n operator with %26 to use the and\noperator.\n\n\nWhen you use the fulltextsearch argument, the API will return the\nobjects enriched with the following two fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheadline\n: The matched words of the key1::value1 found, with\n    \nb\n/b\n items to highlight them.\n\n\nrank\n: The ranking returned by the database. Ranking attempts\n    to measure how relevant documents are to a particular query, so\n    that when there are many matches the most relevant ones can be\n    shown first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you have an example of the expected output for an api call like\nthis:\n\n\n1\n/api/task?project_id=1\ninfo=name::ipsum%26bravo\nfulltextsearch=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n[\n\n  \n{\n\n    \ninfo\n:\n \n{\n\n      \nurl\n:\n \nhttps://domain.com/img.png\n,\n\n      \nname\n:\n \nLore ipsum delta bravo\n,\n\n    \n},\n\n    \nn_answers\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \nquorum\n:\n \n0\n,\n\n    \nlinks\n:\n \n[\n\n      \nlink rel=\nparent\n title=\nproject\n href=\nhttp://localhost:5000/api/project/1\n/\n\n    \n],\n\n    \ncalibration\n:\n \n0\n,\n\n    \nheadline\n:\n \nLore \nb\nipsum\n/b\n delta \nb\nbravo\n/b\n,\n\n    \ncreated\n:\n \n2016-05-10T11:20:45.005725\n,\n\n    \nrank\n:\n \n0.05\n,\n\n    \nstate\n:\n \ncompleted\n,\n\n    \nlink\n:\n \nlink rel=\nself\n title=\ntask\n href=\nhttp://localhost:5001/api/task/1\n/\n,\n\n    \nproject_id\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \npriority_0\n:\n \n0\n\n  \n},\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen you use the fulltextsearch API the results are always sorted by\nrank, showing first the most relevant ones to your query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe use PostgreSQL ts_rank_cd with the following configuration:\nts_rank_cd(textsearch, query, 4). For more details check the official\ndocumentation of PostgreSQL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA uses English for the searches. You can customize this\nbehavior using any of the supported languages by PostgreSQL changing the\nsettings_local.py config variable: \nFULLTEXTSEARCH_LANGUAGE\n =\n\nspanish\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBy default all GET queries return a maximum of 20 objects unless the\n\nlimit\n keyword is used to get more: limit=50. However, a maximum\namount of 100 objects can be retrieved at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the search does not find anything, the server will return an empty JSON\nlist []\n\n\n\n\nExcluding contributed tasks from GET queries\n\n\nFor the Tasks endpoint, you can do also something else, which could be\npretty handy for PYBOSSA projects that are built using only Javascript\n(Single Page Applications) and do not want to use the /newtask endpoint.\n\n\nBasically, you can use any of the previous filters for the /api/task\nendpoint and add the following argument: \nparticipated=1\n to remove\nfrom the results, the tasks that the user has participated in. In this\nway, you will be completely in charge of how the tasks are presented to\nyour users. You will design how they will be delivered.\n\n\nThis endpoint now accepts as well the \nexternal_uid\n parameter, as by\ndefault it identifies authenticated users, as well as anonymouse users.\nIf you are using the external UID, include it.\n\n\nCreate\n\n\nCreate a domain object.

Use the\n\n?api\\_key\n argument to pass the \nAPI-KEY\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf an error occurs, the action will return a JSON object like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n{\n\n    \nstatus\n:\n \nfailed\n,\n\n    \naction\n:\n \nDELETE\n,\n\n    \ntarget\n:\n \nproject\n,\n\n    \nexception_msg\n:\n \ntype object \nProject\n has no attribute \nshort_ame\n,\n\n    \nstatus_code\n:\n \n415\n,\n\n    \nexception_cls\n:\n \nAttributeError\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \ntarget\n will refer to a Project, Task or TaskRun object.\n\n\nFavorites\n\n\nAuthenticated users can mark a task as a favorite. This is useful for\nusers when they want to see all the tasks they have done to remember\nthem. For example, a user can mark as a favorite a picture that\ns\nbeautiful and that he/she has marked as favorited.\n\n\nFor serving this purpose PYBOSSA provides the following api endpoint:\n\n\n1\nGET /api/favorites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the user is authenticated it will return all the tasks the user has\nmarked as favorited.\n\n\nTo add a task as a favorite, a POST should be done with a payload of\n{\ntask_id\n: Task.id}:\n\n\n1\nPOST /api/favorites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor removing one task from the favorites, do a DELETE:\n\n\n1\nDEL /api/favorites/task.id\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to have always the user authenticated, otherwise the user will\nnot be able to see it.\n\n\nRequesting a new task for current user\n\n\nYou can request a new task for the current user (anonymous or\nauthenticated) by:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{project.id}/newtask\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will return a domain Task object in JSON format if there is a task\navailable for the user, otherwise it will return \nNone\n.\n\n\nYou can also use \nlimit\n to get more than 1 task for the user like\nthis:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{project.id}/newtask?limit=100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat query will return 100 tasks for the user.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThat\ns the maximum of tasks that a user can get at once. If you pass an argument of 200,\nPYBOSSA will convert it to 100.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also, use \noffset\n to get the next tasks, if you want,\nallowing you to preload:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{project.id}/newtask?offset=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat query will return the next task for the user, once it solves the\nprevious task.\n\n\nBoth arguments, limit and offset can be used together:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{project.id}/newtask?limit=2offset=2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat will load the next two tasks for the user.\n\n\nAlso you can request the tasks to be sorted by a Task attribute (like\nID, created, etc.) using the following arguments: \norderby\n and\n\ndesc\n to sort them in descending order:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{project.id}/newtask?orderby=priority_0\ndesc=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat query will return the tasks order by priority in descending order,\nin other words, it will return first the tasks with higher priority.\n\n\nRequesting the user\ns oAuth tokens\n\n\nA user who has registered or signed in with any of the third parties\nsupported by PYBOSSA (currently Twitter, Facebook and Google) can\nrequest his own oAuth tokens by doing:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/token?api_key=API-KEY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the user can specify any of the tokens if only its\nretrieval is desired:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/token/{provider}?api_key=API-KEY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nprovider\n will be any of the third parties supported, i.e.\n\ntwitter\n, \nfacebook\n or \ngoogle\n.\n\n\nUsing your own user database\n\n\nSince version v2.3.0 PYBOSSA supports external User IDs. This means that\nyou can easily use your own database of users without having to\nregistering them in the PYBOSSA server. As a benefit, you will be able\nto track your own users within the PYBOSSA server providing a very\nsimple and easy experience for them.\n\n\nA typical case for this would be for example a native phone app\n(Android, iOS or Windows).\n\n\nUsually phone apps have their own user base. With this in mind, you can\nadd a crowdsourcing feature to your phone app by just using PYBOSSA in\nthe following way.\n\n\nFirst, create a project. When you create a project in PYBOSSA the system\nwill create for you a \nsecret key\n. This secret key will be used by your\nphone app to authenticate all the requests and avoid other users to send\ndata to your project via external user API.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe highly recommend using SSL on your server to secure all the process.\nYou can use Let\ns Encrypt certificates for free. Check their\n\ndocumentation.\n\n\n\n\nNow your phone app will have to authenticate to the server to get tasks\nand post task runs.\n\n\nTo do it, all you have to do is to create an HTTP Request with an\nAuthorization Header like this:\n\n\n1\n2\nHEADERS Authorization: project.secret_key\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/auth/project/short_name/token\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat request will return a JWT token for you. With that token, you will\nbe able to start requesting tasks for your user base passing again an\nauthorization header. Imagine a user from your database is identified\nlike this: \n1xa\n:\n\n\n1\n2\nHEADERS Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{project.id}/newtask?external_uid=1xa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat will return a task for the user ID 1xa that belongs to your\ndatabase but not to PYBOSSA. Then, once the user has completed the task\nyou will be able to submit it like this:\n\n\n1\n2\nHEADERS Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ\nPOST http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun?external_uid=1xa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe TaskRun object needs to have the external_uid field filled with\n1xa.\n\n\n\n\nAs simple as that!\n\n\nDisqus Single Sign On (SSO)\n\n\nIf the PYBOSSA server is configured with Disqus SSO keys (see disqus),\nthen you can get the authentication parameters in this endpoint:\n\napi/disqus/sso\n\n\nThe endpoint will return a JSON object with two keys: \napi_key\n and\n\nremote_auth_s3\n. Use those values to authenticate the user in Disqus.\nCheck their official \ndocumentation\n.\n\n\nUser api endpoint ----------------\n\n\nWhile all the other endpoints behave the same, this one is a bit special\nas we deal with private information like emails.\n\n\nAnonymous users\n\n\nThe following actions cannot be done:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new user via a POST\n\n\nUpdate an existing user via a PUT\n\n\nDelete an existing user via a DEL\n\n\n\n\nRead action will only return user name and locale for that user.\n\n\nAuthenticated users\n\n\nThe following actions cannot be done:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new user via a POST\n\n\nUpdate an existing user via a PUT different than the same user\n\n\nDelete an existing user via a DEL\n\n\n\n\nRead action will only return user name and locale for that user. If the\nuser access its own page, then all the information will be available to\nhim/her.\n\n\nAdmin users\n\n\nThe following actions cannot be done:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new user via a POST\n\n\nDelete an existing user via a DEL\n\n\n\n\nRead action can be done on any user. The admins will have access to the\nUser IDs. This will be helpful in case that you want to give, for\nexample badges, for users when using our webhooks solution. Each user\nhas in the info field a new field named \nextra\n where that information\n(or anything else) could be stored.\n\n\nCommand line Example Usage of the API\n\n\nCreate a Project object:\n\n\n1\ncurl -X POST -H \nContent-Type:application/json\n -s -d \n{\nname\n:\nmyproject\n, \ninfo\n:{\nxyz\n:1}}\n \nhttp://localhost:5000/api/project?api_key=API-KEY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYBOSSA endpoints\n\n\nThe following endpoints of PYBOSSA server can be requested setting the\nheader \nContent-Type\n to \napplication/json\n so you can retrieve the data\nusing JavaScript.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf a key has the value \nnull\n is because, that view is not populating\nthat specific field.

It s important to escape the   operator with %26 to use the and\noperator.

As a benefit, you will be able\nto track your own users within the PYBOSSA server providing a very\nsimple and easy experience for them.  A typical case for this would be for example a native phone app\n(Android, iOS or Windows).  Usually phone apps have their own user base. With this in mind, you can\nadd a crowdsourcing feature to your phone app by just using PYBOSSA in\nthe following way.  First, create a project. When you create a project in PYBOSSA the system\nwill create for you a  secret key . This secret key will be used by your\nphone app to authenticate all the requests and avoid other users to send\ndata to your project via external user API.   Note  We highly recommend using SSL on your server to secure all the process.\nYou can use Let s Encrypt certificates for free. Check their documentation.   Now your phone app will have to authenticate to the server to get tasks\nand post task runs.  To do it, all you have to do is to create an HTTP Request with an\nAuthorization Header like this:  1\n2 HEADERS Authorization: project.secret_key\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/auth/project/short_name/token   That request will return a JWT token for you.

            "text": "Configuring PYBOSSA\n\n\nThe PYBOSSA\n\nsettings_local.py.tmpl\n\nfile has all the available configuration options for your server. This\nsection, explains each of them and how you should/could use them in your\nserver.\n\n\nDebug mode\n\n\nThe \nDEBUG\n\nmode is disabled by default in the configuration file, as this should be\nonly used when you are running the server for development purposes. You\nshould not enable this option, unless you need to do some debugging in\nthe PYBOSSA server\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor further details about the DEBUG mode in the PYBOSSA server, please,\ncheck the official \ndocumentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nDebug Toolbar\n\n\nPYBOSSA includes a flag to enable a debug toolbar that can give your\nmore insights about the performance of PYBOSSA. We strongly recommend to\nkeep the toolbar disabled in production environments, as it will slow\ndown considerably all the execution of the code. However, if you are\ntesting the server, feel free to enable it adding the following variable\nto the settings file:\n\n\n1\nENABLE_DEBUG_TOOLBAR\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost and Port\n\n\nThe \nHOST\n\nand \nPORT\n\nconfig variables can be used to force the server to listen in specific\naddresses of your server, as well as at a given port. Usually, you will\nonly need to uncomment the \nHOST\n\nvariable in order to listen in all the net interfaces.\n\n\nSecuring the server\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the \nFlask Sessions\n feature that\nsigns the cookies cryptographically for storing information. This\nimproves the security of the server, as the user could look at the\ncontents of the cookie but not modify it, unless they know the\n\nSECRET\n\nand\n\nSECRET_KEY\n.\n\n\nTherefore, \nit is very important that you create a new SECRET and\nSECRET_KEY keys for your server and keep them private\n. Please, check\nthe \nFlask Sessions\n\ndocumentation for instructions about how to create good secret keys.\n\n\nDatabase username and password\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the \nSQLAlchemy\n SQL toolkit to\naccess the DB. In the settings file, you only need to modify the name of\nthe user, password and database name so it fits your needs in the field\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI:\n\n\n1\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\n \n=\n \npostgresql://username:userpassword@localhost/databasename\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad balancing SQL Queries\n\n\nIf you have a master/slave PostgreSQL setup, you can instruct PYBOSSA to\nuse the slave node for load balancing queries between the master and\nslave node.\n\n\nFor enabling this mode, all you have to do is adding to the\nsettings_local.py config file the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nSQLALCHEMY_BINDS\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nslave\n:\n \npostgresql://user:password@server/pybossadb\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\ns dangerous, so better sign this\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the It\ns dangerous Python library that allows you to send\nsome data to untrusted environments, but signing it. Basically, it uses\na key that the server only knows and uses it for signing the data.\n\n\nThis library is used to send the recovery password e-mails to your\nPYBOSSA users, sending a link with a signed key that will be verified in\nthe server. Thus, \nit is very important you create a secure and private\nkey for the it\ns dangerous module in your configuration file\n, just\nmodify the \nITSDANGEROUSKEY\n.\n\n\nCORS configuration\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA has the api endpoints configured with\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin:\n*. However, you can change it to\nwhatever you want via the config file. Take a look into the official\ndocumentation for Flask-CORS for all the available options.\n\n\nModifying the Brand name\n\n\nYou can configure your project with a different name, instead of the\ndefault one: PYBOSSA. You only need to change the string\n\nBRAND\n\nto the name of your organization or project.\n\n\nAdding a Logo\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA does not provide a logo for the server side, so you\nwill have to copy your logo into the folder:\n\npybossa/pybossa/static/img\n. If the logo name is, \nmy_brand.png\n\nthe \nLOGO\n\nvariable should be updated with the name of the file.\n\n\nMultiple languages\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA only speaks English, however the default theme comes\nwith a few translations (Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Greek and\nGerman).\n\n\nYou can enable those translations (mostly user interface strings and\nactions) by doing the following: creating a symlink to the translations\nfolders:\n\n\n1\n$ \ncd\n pybossa \n ln -s themes/default/translations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will use the default translations of PYBOSSA for your server. We\nrecommend to use these translations with the default theme. If you use\nyour own theme, the best thing is to do your own translation, (see\ntranslating), as you might want to name things differently on the\ntemplates.\n\n\nYou can disable/enable different languages in your config file\n\nsettings_local.py\n. For example, to remove French you can add this\nconfiguration to the settings file:\n\n\n1\n2\nLOCALES\n \n=\n \n[(\nen\n,\n \nEnglish\n),\n \n(\nes\n,\n \nu\nEspa\u00f1ol\n),\n\n           \n(\nit\n,\n \nItaliano\n),\n \n(\nja\n,\n \nu\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, you can always specify a different default locale using the\nfollowing snippet in the same settings file\n\n\n1\nDEFAULT_LOCALE\n \n=\n \nes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA tries to first match the user preferred language from their\nbrowser. This will work for anonymous users, while registered ones\ncan specify the language they want using their user preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs an alternative way to allow anonymous users to \nforce\n a different\nlanguage, PYBOSSA looks for a cookie named \nlanguage\n where it\nexpects the key of any of the supported langes in the LOCALES list.\nYou can use JavaScript to set it up.\n\n\n\n\nCreating your own theme\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports themes. By default, it provides its own theme that you\ncan use or if you prefer, copy it and create your own. The default theme\nfor PYBOSSA is available in the \nrepository\npybossa-default-theme\n.\n\n\nIn order to create your theme, all you have to do is to fork the default\ntheme to your own account, and then start modifying it. A theme has a\nvery simple structure:\n\n\n\n\ninfo.json: this file includes some information about the author,\n    license and name.\n\n\nstatic: this folder has all the CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. In\n    other words, the static content.\n\n\ntemplates: this folder has the templates for PYBOSSA.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, if you want to change the look and feel (i.e. colors of the\ntop bar) all you have to do is to modify the styles.css file of the\nstatic folder. Or if you prefer, create your own.\n\n\nHowever, if you want to modify the structure, let\ns say you want to\nchange the order of the elements of the navigation bar: the first\nelement should be the About link, then you will have to modify the files\nincluded in the templates folder.\n\n\nAs you can see, you will be able to give a full personality to your own\nPYBOSSA server without problems.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can specify a different amount of projects per page if you want. Change\nthe default value in your settings_local.py file of APPS_PER_PAGE\nto the number that you want. By default it gives you access to 20.\n\n\n\n\nUsing SASS and minifying JavaScript\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports SASS thanks to Flask-Assets. If you want to compile\nSASS or SCSS just add to your theme static folder a new one named: sass.\nThen, you can request the compiled version from the templates like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n{% assets filters=\nlibsass\n, output=\ncss/gen/yourcss.min.css\n,\n          \nsass/yourcss.scss\n%}\n    \nlink\n \nrel\n=\nstylesheet\n \ntype\n=\ntext/css\n \nhref\n=\n{{ ASSET_URL }}\n\n{% endassets %}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same can be done for Javascript using the filter minjs:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n{% assets filters=\njsmin\n, output=\ngen/packed.js\n,\n          \ncommon/jquery.js\n, \nsite/base.js\n, \nsite/widgets.js\n %}\n    \nscript\n \ntype\n=\ntext/javascript\n \nsrc\n=\n{{ ASSET_URL }}\n/\nscript\n\n{% endassets %}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults page\n\n\nPYBOSSA allows you to present a results page for your server. Add a file\nnamed results.html to the home directory in the templates folder and\nyou\nll be able to show results about your project from one place:\n\n\n1\n \nhttp://server/results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding your Contact Information\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA provides an e-mail and a Twitter handle to contact\nthe PYBOSSA infrastructure. If you want, you can change it to your own\ne-mail and Twitter account. You can do it, modifying the following\nvariables in the \nsettings_local.py\n file:\n\n\n1\n2\nCONTACT_EMAIL\n \n=\n \nyour@email.com\n\n\nCONTACT_TWITTER\n \n=\n \nyourtwitterhandle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nYou can change and modify the\n\nTERMSOFUSE\n\nfor your server, by overriding the provided URL that we use by default.\nYou can also modify the license used for the data, just change the\nDATAUSE link to the open license that you want to use.\n\n\nAdding Help page\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA provides a help endpoint where you can have your FAQ\nor similar information for your users. However, it\ns empty, as each\nproject is unique. For adding that information, create in the theme\nfolder: templates/help/ a file named \nindex.html\n and write your\ninformation in there. This will render the information under: \nhttp://youserver.com/help/\n\n\nEnabling Twitter, Facebook and Google authentication\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports third party authentication services like Twitter,\nFacebook and Google.\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nIf you want to enable Twitter, you will need to create an application in\n\nTwitter\n and copy and paste the \nConsumer\nkey and secret\n into the next variables and uncomment them:\n\n\n1\n2\nTWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY\n \n=\n \nyourkey\n\n\nTWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET\n \n=\n \nyoursecret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis will also enable the Twitter task importer.\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nIf you want to enable Facebook, you will need to create an application\nin \nFacebook\n and copy and paste\nthe \napp ID/API Key and secret\n into the next variables and uncomment them:\n\n\n1\n2\nFACEBOOK_APP_ID\n \n=\n \nyourappid\n\n\nFACEBOOK_APP_SECRET\n \n=\n \nyoursecret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nIf you want to enable Google, you will need to create an application in\n\nGoogle\n and copy and paste the\n\nClient ID and secret\n into the next variables and uncomment them:\n\n1\n2\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\n \n=\n \nclientid\n\n\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\n \n=\n \nsecret\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiving e-mails with errors\n\n\nIf you want to receive an e-mail when an error occurs in the PYBOSSA\nserver (webhooks, background jobs, etc.), uncomment the\n\nADMINS\n\nconfig variable and add a list of e-mails.\n\n\nBackground jobs error notifications\n\n\nYou can change the default behavior for receiving emails regarding\nfailed background jobs. The two config variables are the following:\n\n\n1\n2\nFAILED_JOBS_MAILS\n \n=\n \n7\n\n\nFAILED_JOBS_RETRIES\n \n=\n \n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAILED_JOBS_MAILS instructs the system to send you a reminder after 7\ndays, if you have not solved the issue with the background job.\n\n\nFAILED_JOBS_RETRIES instructs the system to retry the job N times. By\ndefault is 3.\n\n\nEnabling Logging\n\n\nPYBOSSA can log errors to a\n\nfile\n\nor to a\n\nSentry\n\nserver. If none of the above configurations are used, you will get the\nerrors in the log file of the web server that you are using (i.e. in\nnginx the errors will be in /var/log/nginx/error.log).\n\n\nMail Setup\n\n\nPYBOSSA needs a mail server in order to validate new accounts, send\ne-mails for recovering passwords, etc. , so it is very important you\nconfigure a server. Please, check the section \nMail\nsetup\n\nin the config file for configuring it.\n\n\nGlobal Announcements for the users\n\n\nSometimes you will need to send a message to all your users while they\nare browsing the server. For example, an scheduled shutdown for\ninstalling new hardware.\n\n\nPYBOSSA provides a general solution for these announcements via the\n\nsettings_local.py.tmpl\n\nconfiguration file. The announcement feature allows you to send messages\nto the following type of users:\n\n\n\n\nAuthenticated users\n, basically all the registered users in the\n    server.\n\n\nAdmin users\n, all the users that are admins/root in the server.\n\n\nProject owners\n, all the users that have created one or more\n    projects in the server.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, let\ns say that you want to warn all your admins that a new\nconfiguration will be deployed in your system. In this case, all you\nhave to do is to modify the \nANNOUNCEMENT\n variable to display the\nmessage for the given type of users:\n\n\n1\nANNOUNCEMENT\n \n=\n \n{\nroot\n:\n \nYour secret message\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an example of the \nANNOUNCEMENT\n variable in the\n\nsettings_local.py.tmpl\n\nfile, so you can easily adapt it for your own server. Basically, the\nannouncement variable has a \nkey\n and an associated \nmessage\n. The\nsupported keys are:\n\n\n\n\nadmin\n: for admin users\n\n\nuser\n: for all the registered users (even admins)\n\n\nowner\n: for all registered users that have one or more projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can use a mix of messages at the same time without problems, so for\nexample you can display a message for Admins and Owners at the same\ntime.\n\n\n\n\nCache\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA uses Redis to cache a lot of data in order to serve\nit as fast as possible. PYBOSSA comes with a default set of timeouts for\ndifferent views that you can change or modify to your own taste. All you\nhave to do is modify the following variables in your settings file:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n# Project cache\n\n\nAPP_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n15\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nREGISTERED_USERS_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n15\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nANON_USERS_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n5\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nSTATS_FRONTPAGE_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n12\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nSTATS_APP_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n12\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nSTATS_DRAFT_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n24\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nN_APPS_PER_CATEGORY_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nBROWSE_TASKS_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n3\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n# Category cache\n\n\nCATEGORY_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n24\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n# User cache\n\n\nUSER_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n15\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nUSER_TOP_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n24\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nUSER_TOTAL_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n24\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEvery value is in seconds, so bear in mind to multiply it by 60 in order to\nhave minutes in the configuration values.\n\n\n\n\nDisabling the Cache\n\n\nIf you want to disable the cache, you only have to export the following\nenv variable:\n\n\n1\nPYBOSSA_REDIS_CACHE_DISABLED\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate limit for the API\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA limits the usage of the API with the following\nvalues:\n\n\n1\n2\nLIMIT\n \n=\n \n300\n\n\nPER\n \n=\n \n15\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose values mean that when a user sends a request to an API endpoint, a\nwindow of 15 minutes is open, and during those 15 minutes the number of\nallowed requests to the same endpoint is 300. By adding these values to\nyour settings_local.py file, you can adapt it to your own needs.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease, be sure about what you are doing by modifying these values. This is\nthe recommended configuration, so do not modify it unless you are\nsure.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring upload method\n\n\nPYBOSSA by default allows you to upload avatars for users, icons for\nprojects, etc. using the local file system of your server. While this is\nnice for small setups, when you need to add more nodes to serve the same\ncontent, this feature could become a problem. For this reason, PYBOSSA\nalso supports cloud solutions to save the files and serve them from\nthere properly.\n\n\nLocal Uploader\n\n\nThe local uploader is configured by default. We recommend to have a\nseparate folder for the assets, outside the pybossa folder. In any case,\nfor enabling this method use the following the config settings:\n\n\n1\n2\nUPLOAD_METHOD\n \n=\n \nlocal\n\n\nUPLOAD_FOLDER\n \n=\n \n/absolute/path/to/your/folder/to/store/assets/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRackspace Cloud Files\n\n\nPYBOSSA comes with support for Rackspace CloudFiles service, allowing\nyou to grow horizontally the services. Suportting cloud based system is\nas simple as having an account in Rackspace, and setting up the\nfollowing config variables:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nUPLOAD_METHOD\n \n=\n \nrackspace\n\n\nRACKSPACE_USERNAME\n \n=\n \nusername\n\n\nRACKSPACE_API_KEY\n \n=\n \napi_key\n\n\nRACKSPACE_REGION\n \n=\n \nregion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the server is started, it will authenticate against Rackspace and\nsince that moment, your PYBOSSA server will save files in the cloud.\n\n\nCustomizing the Layout and Front Page text\n\n\nPYBOSSA allows you to override two items:\n\n\n\n\nFront Page Text\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to override those items, you have to create a folder named\n\ncustom\n and place it in the \ntemplate\n dir. Then for overriding:\n\n\n\n\nThe Front Page Text\n: create a file named\n  \nfront_page_text.html\n and write there some HTML.\n\n\nThe Footer\n: create a file named \n_footer.html\n, and write\n  some HTML.\n\n\n\n\nTracking the server with Google Analytics\n\n\nPYBOSSA provides an easy way to integrate Google Analytics with your\nPYBOSSA server. In order to enable it you only have to create a file\nwith the name: \n_ga.html\n in the \npybossa/template\n folder with the\nGoogle Tracking code. PYBOSSA will be including your Google Analytics\ntracking code in every page since that moment.\n\n\nThe file \n_ga.html\n should contain something like this:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nscript\n \ntype\n=\ntext/javascript\n\n  \nvar\n \n_gaq\n \n=\n \n_gaq\n \n||\n \n[];\n\n  \n_gaq\n.\npush\n([\n_setAccount\n,\n \nUA-XXXXXXXX-X\n]);\n\n  \n_gaq\n.\npush\n([\n_trackPageview\n]);\n\n\n  \n(\nfunction\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nga\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ncreateElement\n(\nscript\n);\n \nga\n.\ntype\n \n=\n \ntext/javascript\n;\n \nga\n.\nasync\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \nga\n.\nsrc\n \n=\n \n(\nhttps:\n \n==\n \ndocument\n.\nlocation\n.\nprotocol\n \n?\n \nhttps://ssl\n \n:\n \nhttp://www\n)\n \n+\n \n.google-analytics.com/ga.js\n;\n\n    \nvar\n \ns\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementsByTagName\n(\nscript\n)[\n0\n];\n \ns\n.\nparentNode\n.\ninsertBefore\n(\nga\n,\n \ns\n);\n\n  \n})();\n\n\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Search box: Google Custom Search\n\n\nPYBOSSA provides a simple way to search within the server pages: Google\nCustom Search. In order to enable it you will have to apply for a Google\nCustom Search API key and then follow the next steps:\n\n\n\n\nCopy the Google Custom Search \nscript\n code\n\n\nCreate a new file called \n_gcs.html\n in the templates folder\n\n\nPaste the previous snippet of code (be sure to delete the\n  \ngcs:search\n/gcse:search\n line from it.\n\n\nCopy the \n_gcs_form.html.template\n as \n_gcs_form.html\n and\n  add your key in the input field \ncx\n (you will find a text like\n  XXXXX:YYYY where you should paste your key)\n\n\n\n\nThe \n_gcs.html\n file will have something like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nscript\n\n  \n(\nfunction\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \ncx\n \n=\n \nXXXXX:YYYY\n;\n\n    \nvar\n \ngcse\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ncreateElement\n(\nscript\n);\n \ngcse\n.\ntype\n \n=\n \ntext/javascript\n;\n \ngcse\n.\nasync\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \ngcse\n.\nsrc\n \n=\n \n(\ndocument\n.\nlocation\n.\nprotocol\n \n==\n \nhttps:\n \n?\n \nhttps:\n \n:\n \nhttp:\n)\n \n+\n\n        \n//www.google.com/cse/cse.js?cx=\n \n+\n \ncx\n;\n\n    \nvar\n \ns\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementsByTagName\n(\nscript\n)[\n0\n];\n \ns\n.\nparentNode\n.\ninsertBefore\n(\ngcse\n,\n \ns\n);\n\n  \n})();\n\n\n/\nscript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the \n_gcs_form.html\n will be like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n    \nform\n \nclass\n=\nnavbar-form\n \nstyle\n=\npadding-top:20px;\n \naction\n=\n/search\n\n          \ninput\n \ntype\n=\nhidden\n \nname\n=\ncx\n \nvalue\n=\npartner-pub-XXXXX:YYYYY\n/\n\n          \ninput\n \ntype\n=\nhidden\n \nname\n=\ncof\n \nvalue\n=\nFORID:10\n \n/\n\n          \ninput\n \ntype\n=\nhidden\n \nname\n=\nie\n \nvalue\n=\nISO-8859-1\n \n/\n\n          \ndiv\n \nclass\n=\ninput-append\n\n          \ninput\n \ntype\n=\ntext\n \nname\n=\nq\n \nsize\n=\n21\n \nclass\n=\ninput-small\n \nplaceholder\n=\nSearch\n  \n/\n\n          \nspan\n \nclass\n=\nadd-on\ni\n \nclass\n=\nicon-search\n \nstyle\n=\ncolor:black\n/\ni\n/\nspan\n\n          \n/\ndiv\n\n    \n/\nform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter these steps, your site will be indexed by Google and Google Custom\nSearch will be working, providing for your users a search tool.\n\n\nAdding web maps for project statistics\n\n\nPYBOSSA creates for each project a statistics page, where the creators\nof the project and the volunteers can check the top 5 anonymous and\nauthenticated users, an estimation of time about when all the tasks will\nbe completed, etc.\n\n\nOne interesting feature of the statistics page is that it can generate a\nweb map showing the location of the anonymous volunteers that have been\nparticipating in the project. By default the maps are disabled, because\nyou will need to download the GeoLiteCity DAT file database that will be\nuse for generating the maps.\n\n\nGeoLite\n is a free\ngeolocatication database from MaxMind that they release under a\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Uported\nLicense\n. You can\ndownload the required file: GeoLite City from this\n\npage\n.\nOnce you have downloaded the file, all you have to do is to uncompress\nit and place it in the folder \ndat\n of the pybossa root folder.\n\n\nAfter copying the file, all you have to do to start creating the maps is\nto restart the server.\n\n\nUsing your own Terms of Use\n\n\nPYBOSSA has a default Terms of Service page that you can customize it to\nfit your institutional needs. In the case that you do not want to use\nthe default one, please, create a \n_tos.html\n file in the \ncustom\n\nfolder. You can re-use the template \nhelp/_tos.html\n and adapt it (it\nis located in the \ntemplate/help\n folder.\n\n\nUsing your own Cookies Policy\n\n\nPYBOSSA has a default cookies policy page, but you can customize it to\nfit your institutional needs. In the case that you do not want to use\nthe default one, please, create a \n_cookies_policy.html\n file in the\n\ncustom\n folder. You can re-use the template\n\nhelp/_cookies_policy.html\n and adapt it (it is located in the\n\ntemplate/help\n folder.\n\n\nUsing your own Privacy Policy\n\n\nPYBOSSA has a blank privacy policy page. We recommend you to add one, so\nyour users know how you are using their data. To add it, just create a\nfile named \n_privacy_policy.html\n file in the \ncustom\n folder.\n\n\nExporting data to a CKAN server\n\n\nCKAN\n is a powerful data management system that makes\ndata accessible \u2013 by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing,\nfinding and using data. \nCKAN\n is aimed at data\npublishers (national and regional governments, companies and\norganizations) wanting to make their data open and available.\n\n\nPYBOSSA can export project\ns data to a \nCKAN\n server.\nIn order to use this feature, you will need to add the following config\nvariables to the settings_loca.py file:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n# CKAN URL for API calls\n\n\nCKAN_NAME\n \n=\n \nDemo CKAN server\n\n\nCKAN_URL\n \n=\n \nhttp://demo.ckan.org\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs \nCKAN\n is open source, you can install your own\n\nCKAN\n server and configure it to host the data\ngenerated by your PYBOSSA projects quite easily, making it the data\nrepository for your own projects. Another alternative is to use the \nthe\nData hub\n service that it is actually a free CKAN\nservice for hosting your data.\n\n\nEnforce Privacy mode\n\n\nSome projects need sometimes a way to protect their contributors due to\nthe nature of the project. In this cases, where privacy is really\nimportant, PYBOSSA allows you to \nlock\n all the public pages related\nto the users and statistics about the site and projects. Specifically,\nby enabling this mode only administrators will be able to see the\nfollowing pages:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://server/stats\n\n\nhttp://server/account/\n\n\nhttp://server/account/user/\n\n\nhttp://server/project/stats\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous and authenticated will see a warning message like this:\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the footer and front page top users will be removed with\nlinks to all these pages. If your project needs this type of protection\nyou can enable it by changing the following config variable in your\n\nsettings_local.py\n file from:\n\n\n1\nENFORCE_PRIVACY\n \n=\n \nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n\n\n1\nENFORCE_PRIVACY\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis feature is disabled by default.\n\n\n\n\nMaking extra key/value pairs in info field public\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA protects all the information the info field except\nfor those values that are public like the url of the image of the\nproject, the container where that picture is stored and a few extra.\nWhile this will be more than enough for most projects, sometimes, a\nserver will need to expose more information publicly via the info field\nfor the User and Project Domain Objects.\n\n\nImagine that you want to give badges to users. You can store that\ninformation in the User domain object, within the info field in a field\nnamed \nbadges\n. While this will work, the API will hide all that\ninformation except for the owner. Thus, it will be impossible to show\nuser\ns badges to anonymous people.\n\n\nWith projects it could be the same. You want to highlight some info to\nanyone, but hide everything else.\n\n\nAs PYBOSSA hides everything by default, you can always turn on which\nother fields from the info field can be shown to anonymous users, making\nthem public.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nBe very careful. This is your responsibility, and it\ns not\nenabled by default. If you expose your own private data via this field,\nit\ns your own responsibility as this is not enabled by default in\nPYBOSSA.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to make some key/values public, all you have to do is add to\nthe settings_local.py file the following config variables:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nPROJECT_INFO_PUBLIC_FIELDS\n \n=\n \n[\nkey1\n,\n \nkey2\n]\n\n\nUSER_INFO_PUBLIC_FIELDS\n \n=\n \n[\nbadges\n,\n \nkey2\n,\n \n...\n]\n\n\nCATEGORY_INFO_PUBLIC_FIELDS\n \n=\n \n[\nkey1\n,\n \nkey2\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd as many as you want, need. But please, be careful about which\ninformation you disclose.\n\n\nAdding your own templates\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports different types of templates that you can offer for\nevery project. By default, PYBOSSA comes with the following templates:\n\n\n\n\nBasic\n: the most basic template. It only has the basic\n  structure to develop your project.\n\n\nImage\n: this template is for image pattern recognition.\n\n\nSound\n: similar to the image template, but for sound clips\n  hosted in SoundCloud.\n\n\nVideo\n: similar to the imaage template, but for video clips\n  hostes in Vimeo.\n\n\nMap\n: this template is for geocoding prorjects.\n\n\nPDF\n: this template is for transcribing documents.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to add your own template, or remove one, just create in the\nsettings_local.py file a variable named \nPRESENTERS\n and add remove\nthe ones you want:\n\n\n1\nPRESENTERS\n \n=\n \n[\nbasic\n,\n \nimage\n,\n \nsound\n,\n \nvideo\n,\n \nmap\n,\n \npdf\n,\n \nyourtemplate\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYourtemplate\n should be a template that you have to save in the theme\nfolder: \n/templates/projects/snippets/\n with the same name. Check the\nother templates to use them as a base layer for your template.\n\n\nAfter adding the template, the server will start offering this new\ntemplate to your users.\n\n\nIn addition to the project templates themselves, you can add some test\ntasks for those projects so that the users can import them to their\nprojects and start \nplaying\n with them, or taking their format as a\nstarting point to create their own. These tasks can be imported from\nGoogle Docs spreadsheets, and you can add them, remove them, or modify\nthe URLs of the spreadsheets changing the value of the variable\n\nTEMPLATE_TASKS\n in settings_local.py:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nTEMPLATE_TASKS\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nimage\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdHFEN29mZUF0czJWMUhIejF6dWZXdkE\nusp=sharing\n,\n\n    \nsound\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdEczcWduOXRUb1JUc1VGMmJtc2xXaXc\nusp=sharing\n,\n\n    \nvideo\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdGZ2UGhxSTJjQl9YNVhfUVhGRUdoRWc\nusp=sharing\n,\n\n    \nmap\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdGZnbjdwcnhKRVNlN1dGXy0tTnNWWXc\nusp=sharing\n,\n\n    \npdf\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdEVVamc0R0hrcjlGdXRaUXlqRXlJMEE\nusp=sharing\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting an expiration time for project passwords\n\n\nPYBOSSA allows the owner of a project to set a password so that only\npeople (both anonymous or authenticated) that know it can contribute. By\nentering this password, the user will have access to the project for a\ntime specified by:\n\n\n1\nPASSWD_COOKIE_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n60\n \n*\n \n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich defaults to 30 minutes.\n\n\nValidation of new user accounts\n\n\nWhenever a new user wants to sign up, PYBOSSA allows you to add some\nextra security to the process by making the users have to validate a\nreal email account.\n\n\nHowever, if you don\nt need this feature, it can be disabled (as it is by\ndefault) with this configuration parameter:\n\n\n1\nACCOUNT_CONFIRMATION_DISABLED\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo factor authentication on login\n\n\nIf you need an extra layer of security for user authentication, PYBOSSA\nallows you to enable two factor authentication by setting this\nconfiguration value:\n\n\n1\nENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTH\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this parameter set, after password verification users will receive\na one-time code in their email, and will be redirected to a page where\nthey can insert the code to complete the login process.\n\n\nSending weekly email stats to project owners\n\n\nProject owners that have the pro flag set to True can receive every week\nan update with the latest statistics about their projects in their email\nbox.\n\n\nBy default this email is sent every Sunday. You can modify it in the\nsettings file by changing it to another day:\n\n\n1\nWEEKLY_UPDATE_STATS\n \n=\n \nTuesday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters with Mailchimp\n\n\nPYBOSSA can show a subscription page to users when they create an\naccount. By default is disabled, but if you want to enable it the system\nwill show the page to registered users only once, to check if they want\nto be subscribed or not.\n\n\nIn order to support newsletters, you\nll have to create an account in\nMailchimp and get an API_KEY as well as a LIST_ID to add the users.\nOnce you\nve those two items you can enable the newsletter subscription\nas simple as this, add to your settings_local.py file the following\nvalues:\n\n\n1\n2\nMAILCHIMP_API_KEY\n \n=\n \nyour-key\n\n\nMAILCHIMP_LIST_ID\n \n=\n \nyour-list-id\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the server, and you will be done. Now in your Mailchimp account\nyou will be able to create campaigns, and communicate with your\nregistered and interested users.\n\n\nEnabling the Flickr Task importer\n\n\nPYBOSSA has several different types of built-in importers. Users can use\nthem to import tasks for their projects directly from the Web interface.\nHowever, using the Flickr one requires an API key and shared secret from\nFlickr in order to communicate with the service.\n\n\nOnce you have an API key, you\nll have to add it to your\nsettings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\n2\nFLICKR_API_KEY\n \n=\n \nyour-key\n\n\nFLICKR_SHARED_SECRET\n \n=\n \nyour-secret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on how to get a Flickr API key and shared secret,\nplease refer to \nhere\n.\n\n\nEnabling the Dropbox Task importer\n\n\nPYBOSSA also offers the Dropbox importer, which allows to import\ndirectly all kind of files from a Dropbox account. In order to use it,\nyou\nll need to register your PYBOSSA server as a Dropbox app, as\nexplained\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nDon\nt worry about the Javascript snippet part, we\nve already handled\nthat for you. Instead, get the App key you will be given and add it to\nyour settings_local.py:\n\n\n1\nDROPBOX_APP_KEY\n \n=\n \nyour-key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling the Twitter Task importer\n\n\nIf you already have enabled the Twitter authentication, then the Twitter\ntask importer will be enabled too. Otherwise, you will need to create an\napplication in \nTwitter\n and copy and paste\nthe \nConsumer key and secret\n into the next variables and uncoment them:\n\n1\n2\nTWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY\n \n=\n \nkey\n\n\nTWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET\n \n=\n \nsecret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis will also enable PYBOSSA\ns Twitter login.\n\n\n\n\nEnabling the Youtube Task importer\n\n\nThe Youtube task importer needs a Youtube server key which you need to\ncreate in the \nGoogle API\nConsole\n in YouTube Data API.\n\n\nOnce you have an API key, you\nll have to add it to your\nsettings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\nYOUTUBE_API_SERVER_KEY\n \n=\n \nyour-key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on how to get a Youtube server key, please refer to\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nEnabling Server Sent Events\n\n\nSince PYBOSSA v1.1.0, PYBOSSA supports Server Sent Events (SSE) in some\nviews. This feature is really powerfull, however it brings some issues\nwith it: it need to run PYBOSSA in asynchronous mode.\n\n\nAs this is not a necessity, by default PYBOSSA has this feature\ndisabled. PYBOSSA uses SSE to notify users about specific actions (i.e.\nthe result of a webhook in real time).\n\n\nIf you want to enable it, you will have to add to your\nsettings_local.py:\n\n\n1\nSSE\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, you will need to configure uwsgi and nginx to support SSE events.\nThis is not trivial, as there are several different scenarios, libraries\nand options, so instead of recommending one solution, we invite you to\nread the \nuwsgi documentation about\nit\n, so you can\ntake a decission based on your own infrastructure and preferences.\n\n\nLatest news from PYBOSSA\n\n\nSince version v1.2.1 PYBOSSA gets the latest news of its new releases,\nas well as anything related to what it\ns produced by SciFabric regarding\nthe crowdsourcing world. You can add more items if you want, by just\nadding to your settings_local.py file new ATOM URLs:\n\n\n1\nNEWS_URL\n \n=\n \n[\nhttp:/http:///atomurl1\n,\n \nhttp://atomurl2\n,\n \n...\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling pro user features\n\n\nSince version v1.2.2 PYBOSSA allows making available to all the users\ncertain features that were before reserved to pro users.\n\n\nJust locate them in the settings_local.py file. By default, they look\nlike:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nPRO_FEATURES\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nauditlog\n:\n              \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nwebhooks\n:\n              \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nupdated_exports\n:\n       \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nnotify_blog_updates\n:\n   \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nproject_weekly_report\n:\n \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nautoimporter\n:\n          \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nbetter_stats\n:\n          \nTrue\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy choosing \nTrue\n on each of them, you are making that specific feature\navailable only to pro users. On the other hand, selecting \nFalse\n makes\nthem available to regular users as well.\n\n\nStrict Slashes\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA distinguish between two types of URLs for its\nendpoints: with and without a traling slash. In other words, if an\nendpoint is not declared within the code as accepting both options,\naccessing the same endpoint with a trailing slash will return a 404.\n\n\nFor example, the about endpoint:\n\n\n1\nGET /about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill return the page, but with the default configuration it will return\na 404 if you add a trailing slash to it:\n\n\n1\nGET /about/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable this behavior, just use the STRICT_SLASHES option and set it\nto False. That option willensure that both endpoints works with and\nwithout the trailing slash.\n\n\nDisqus Single Sign On (SSO)\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports Disqus SSO, however it is disabled by default. You need\nto register a Disqus application (see their\n\ndocumentation\n)\nand then update your settings_local.py file with the following two\nkeys:\n\n\n1\n2\nDISQUS_SECRET_KEY\n \n=\n \nsecret\n\n\nDISQUS_PUBLIC_KEY\n \n=\n \npublickey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, this will enable you to use a new Jinja2 filter for authenticating\nPYBOSSA users directly in their Disqus server. The filter is\n\ndisqus_sso\n. You can use it like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{%\n \nif\n \ncurrent_user.is_authenticated\n()\n \n%}\n\n\n{{\n \ncurrent_user\n \n|\n \ndisqus_sso\n \n|\n \nsafe\n \n}}\n\n\n{%\n \nelse\n \n%}\n\n\n{{\n \nNone\n \n|\n \ndisqus_sso\n \n|\n \nsafe\n \n}}\n\n\n{%\n \nendif\n \n%}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if you are building a Single Page Application, you can use our API\nendpoint: \napi/disqus/sso\n to get the credentials and authenticate the\nusers within your javascript. Check the endpoint information disqus-api.\n\n\nBackground jobs timeout\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA timeout for every job is 10 minutes. In principle it\nshould be fine, but each project and server is unique, so if you start\nseeing to many jobs failing because the job timed out, then, increase\nthe value using this config variables:\n\n\n1\n2\nMINUTE\n \n=\n \n60\n\n\nTIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n20\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Push notifications\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou need to have HTTPS enabled for your site, otherwise you will need to\nuse a subdomain from onesignal.com in order to support this feature. If\nyou cannot use HTTPS we recommend to not enable it.\n\n\n\n\nPYBOSSA can send web push notifications to Google Chrome, Mozilla\nFirefox and Safari browsers.\n\n\nFor supporting this feature, PYBOSSA uses the Onesignal.com service. You\nwill need an account and create an app for your PYBOSSA server. Then\nfollow their documentation to download the WebPush SDK and configure\nyour PYBOSSA theme.\n\n\nFor more info regarding Onesignal, check their\n\ndocumentation.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can host the SDK files in the static folder of your theme. However\nyou will need to modify your web server (Apache or Nginx) to serve those\nfiles as from the root of your server. If this is not done properly, it\nwill not work.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have created the app in Onesignal get the API KEY and APP ID.\nThen copy them and put it in your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\n2\nONESIGNAL_APP_ID\n \n=\n \napp-id\n\n\nONESIGNAL_API_KEY\n \n=\n \napp-key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the server, and add one background worker for the \nwebpush\n\nqueue. This queue will handle the creation of the apps, as well as\nsending the push notifications.\n\n\nThen you will need to update your PYBOSSA theme in order to allow your\nusers to subscribe. As this could vary a lot from one project to\nanother, we do not provide a template but some guidelines:\n\n\n\n\nUse the JS SDK to subscribe a user to a given project using the\n  \ntags\n option of Onesignal.\n\n\nPYBOSSA sends notifications using those tags thanks to the\n  \nfilters\n option that allows us to segment traffic. PYBOSSA is\n  especting the project.id as the tag key for segmenting.\n\n\nThe JS SDK allows you to subscribe/unsubscribe a user to a give\n  project (not only the whole server) with special methods for\n  adding tags and deleting them. This works independently if the\n  user is authenticated or not.\n\n\n\n\nFor more info regarding Onesignal JS SDK, check their\n\ndocumentation.\n\n\nIgnore specific keys when exporting data in CSV format\n\n\nSometimes your PYBOSSA project saves information like GeoJSON within the\ntasks or task_runs. This is a bad thing for the exporter, as it will\ntry to flatten it. In such scenarios, you want to instruct PYBOSSA to\nignore those keys, as they will be included in the JSON export files,\nand reduce all the overhead (as well as destroying the format due to the\nnormalization).\n\n\nFor ignoring a key (or a list of keys), just add the following config\nvariable to your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\nIGNORE_FLAT_KEYS\n \n=\n \n[\n \ngeojson\n,\n \nkey1\n,\n \n...\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable task presenter check for pure JavaScript apps\n\n\nWhen you are using PYBOSSA native JSON support, you will not be building\nyour project presenter within the PYBOSSA structure, but within the JS\nframework of your choice.\n\n\nIn such a case, you would like to disable the check for the\ntask_presenter when publishing a project. If you need this, just add\nthis flag to your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\nDISABLE_TASK_PRESENTER\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsent field for users\n\n\nSometimes you will need the users to click in a check box before\ncreating an account to get the agreement for sending them email\nnotifications or of any other type. By default PYBOSSA provides this\nflag, and it\ns set to False.\n\n\nChange in the theme (or your frontend) the label of the field to\nwhatever you prefer: Terms of Service, Communications, etc. so you will\nbe able to keep track of who has accepted/declined to get notifications\nfrom you.\n\n\nCustom Leaderboards\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA provides a unique leaderboard. This leaderboard is\nbased on the number of task runs that a user has submitted, however, you\nmay want more flexibility. For this reason, you can use use the\n\nuser\n.info field to store any other \nbadges\n or values that you want to\nscore your users.\n\n\nIf your users have identified very complicated stuff, and you want to\ngive points to them based on that, just use the info field and instruct\nPYBOSSA to create a leaderboard for you.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIt is imoportant that this key,value pair is computed by you. You can\nuse the API to update these values, so this will not be handled by\nPYBOSSA but by yourself.\n\n\n\n\nImagine the score is named: foo, then, PYBOSSA will create for you a\nleaderboard using that key like this: edit the settings_local.py file\nand add the following config variable:\n\n\n1\nLEADERBOARDS\n \n=\n \n[\nfoo\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you can access the specific leaderboard using the endpoint:\n/leaderboard/?info=foo\n\n\nAs simple as that.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis feature relies on background jobs. Be sure that you are running\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nUnpublish inactive projects\n\n\nPYBOSSA by default unpublishes projects that have not been active in the\nlast 3 months. You can disable this feature by changing this config\nvariable in your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\nUNPUBLISH_PROJECTS\n \n=\n \nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAP integration\n\n\nPYBOSSA can use LDAP for authenticating users. Basically, you will need\nto add a few config variables to the settings_local.py file in order to\nmake it work.\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports LDAP and OpenLDAP protocols, so you should be able to\nuse any of them.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBy enabling PYBOSSA LDAP integration, all other means for creating accounts and/or\nsignin will be disabled.\n\n\n\n\nLDAP_HOST\n\n\nThis variable should have the IP or domain name of your LDAP server.\n\n\nLDAP_BASE_DN\n\n\nThis is the LDAP Base DN for your organization.\n\n\nLDAP_USERNAME\n\n\nThis variable should have the admin account, so PYBOSSA can access the\nLDAP server and search for users.\n\n\nLDAP_PASSWORD\n\n\nThe admin account password.\n\n\nLDAP_OBJECTS_DN\n\n\nThe DN.\n\n\nLDAP_OPENLDAP\n\n\nSet it to True if you are using it.\n\n\nLDAT_USER_OBJECT_FILTER\n\n\nThis is really important. The filter that you write in here needs to be\nadapted to your institution, otherwise it will not work when\nauthenticating and validating your users.\n\n\nDon\nt use the default configuration in the settings template.

If\nyou cannot use HTTPS we recommend to not enable it.   PYBOSSA can send web push notifications to Google Chrome, Mozilla\nFirefox and Safari browsers.  For supporting this feature, PYBOSSA uses the Onesignal.com service. You\nwill need an account and create an app for your PYBOSSA server. Then\nfollow their documentation to download the WebPush SDK and configure\nyour PYBOSSA theme.  For more info regarding Onesignal, check their documentation.   Note  You can host the SDK files in the static folder of your theme. However\nyou will need to modify your web server (Apache or Nginx) to serve those\nfiles as from the root of your server. If this is not done properly, it\nwill not work.   After you have created the app in Onesignal get the API KEY and APP ID.\nThen copy them and put it in your settings_local.py file:  1\n2 ONESIGNAL_APP_ID   =   app-id  ONESIGNAL_API_KEY   =   app-key    Restart the server, and add one background worker for the  webpush \nqueue. This queue will handle the creation of the apps, as well as\nsending the push notifications.  Then you will need to update your PYBOSSA theme in order to allow your\nusers to subscribe. As this could vary a lot from one project to\nanother, we do not provide a template but some guidelines:   Use the JS SDK to subscribe a user to a given project using the\n   tags  option of Onesignal.  PYBOSSA sends notifications using those tags thanks to the\n   filters  option that allows us to segment traffic. PYBOSSA is\n  especting the project.id as the tag key for segmenting.  The JS SDK allows you to subscribe/unsubscribe a user to a give\n  project (not only the whole server) with special methods for\n  adding tags and deleting them. This works independently if the\n  user is authenticated or not.   For more info regarding Onesignal JS SDK, check their documentation.",

We will try to help you and\nadd your question to the FAQ.\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nDo I need to create an account to participate in the project?\n\n\nIt depends. The owners of the projects can disable anonymous\ncontributions (usually due to privacy issues with the data), forcing you\nto create an account if you want to contribute to that specific project.\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nHow can I create a project?\n\n\nYou can create a project using web forms, or if you prefer it using the\nAPI. We recommend you to read the user/overview and user/tutorial\nsections.\n\n\nCan I disable anonymous contributions?\n\n\nYes, you can. Check your project settings and toggle the drop down menu:\n\nAllow Anonymous Contributors\n from Yes to No. Check the project-details\nfor further information.\n\n\nCan I create \ngolden tasks\n?\n\n\nYes, you can. PYBOSSA has a field for every Task named: \ncalibration\n\nthat will identify the task as a \ngolden\n task or as we call them as a\n\ncalibration task\n. Calibration tasks can be used to weight the answers\nof the volunteers (authenticated and anonymous) as you know the answer\nfor those given tasks. For example, if a user has answered all the\ncalibration tasks correctly you can give a weight of 1 point to all\nhis/her answers, while if the user only answered 50% of them correctly,\nthe answers for the rest of the tasks could be given a weight of 0.5\npoints.\n\n\nCan I delete my project and all the task and task runs?\n\n\nYes, you can. If you are the owner of the project you can delete the\nproject, and automatically all the task and associated task runs will be\ndeleted (\nnote\n: this cannot be undone!). Check the project-delete\nsection for further details.\n\n\nDo you provide any statistics about the users for my project?\n\n\nYes, every project has its own statistics page that shows information\nabout the distribution of answers per type of user, an estimation about\nhow long it will take to complete all your tasks, the top 5\nauthenticated and anonymous users, etc. Check the \nStatistics\n link in\nthe left local sidebar of your project.\n\n\nMy project is not getting too much attention, how can it be a \nfeatured\n project?\n\n\nFeatured projects are managed by the administrators of the site. Contact\nthem about this issue, and they will decide about your project.\n\n\nI have all my data in a CSV file, can I import it?\n\n\nYes, you can. PYBOSSA supports the CSV format, so all you have to do is\nupload your file to a file server like DropBox, copy the public link and\npaste it in the importer section. PYBOSSA also supports Google Drive\nSpreadsheets, see csv-import section for further details.\n\n\nMy data is in a Google Doc Spreadsheet, can I import the data into my project?\n\n\nYes, you can. PYBOSSA supports the Google Drive Spreadsheets, so make it\npublic, copy the link and use that link to import it the Google Drive\nimporter section. See csv-import section for further details.\n\n\nAll my tasks have been completed, how do I download the results to analyze them?\n\n\nYou can export all the data of your project whenever you want. The data\ncan be exported directly from the \nTasks\n section (check the \nTasks\n\nlink in the left sidebar of your project and click in the export box).\nPYBOSSA can export your tasks and task runs (or answers) to a CSV file,\nJSON format or to a CKAN server. See the export-results section for\nfurther details.\n\n\nWhat is a Task Run?\n\n\nA Task Run is a submitted answer sent by one user (authenticated or\nanonymous) to one of the tasks of your project. In other words, it is\nthe work done by one volunteer for one task.\n\n\nWhat is the Task Presenter?\n\n\nThe task presenter is the web project that will load the tasks of your\nproject and present them to the user. It is an HTML + JavaScript\nproject. See the task-presenter section for further details.\n\n\nPYBOSSA\n\n\nDoes PYBOSSA have an API?\n\n\nYes, it does. PYBOSSA has a api that allows you to create projects,\ndownload results, import tasks, etc. Please see the api section for more\ndetails and the user/tutorial for a full example about how you can use\nit.\n\n\nIs PYBOSSA open-source?\n\n\nYes, it is. PYBOSSA is licensed under the \nGNU Affero general public\nlicense version 3.0\n.\n\n\nDo you provide project templates or examples projects?\n\n\nYes, we do. You can find several open source project examples that can\nbe re-used for image/sound pattern recognition problems, geo-coding, PDF\ntranscription, etc. Check the official \nGit\nrepository\n for all the available\nprojects.\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nPYBOSSA is free and open source, that means that anyone can create a\nproject and benefit from the endless features that PYBOSSA has to offer,\nso that you can reach your ultimate goal.

In this page, you will\nget a step by step guide about how to install all the required packages\nand libraries for PYBOSSA using the latest \nUbuntu Server Long Term\nSupport\n version available at the moment:\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS\n\n\n\n\nInstalling git - a distributed version control system\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the \ngit\n distributed version control\nsystem for handling the PYBOSSA server source code as well as the\ntemplate projects.\n\n\nGit\n is a free and open source distributed version\ncontrol system designed to handle everything from small to very large\nprojects with seepd and efficiency.\n\n\nIn order to install the software, all you have to do is:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install git-core\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the PostgreSQL database\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n is a powerful, open source\nobject-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active\ndevelopment and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong\nreputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses \nPostgreSQL\n as the main\ndatabase for storing all the data, and you the required steps for\ninstalling it are the following:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all libpq-dev python-psycopg2 libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling virtualenv (optional, but recommended)\n\n\nWe recommend to install PYBOSSA using a\n\nvirtualenv\n as it will create a\nan isolated Python environment, helping you to manage different\ndependencies and versions without having to deal with root permissions\nin your server machine.\n\n\nvirtualenv\n creates an\nenvironment that has its own installation directories, that doesn\nt\nshare libraries with other virtualenv environments (and optionally\ndoesn\nt access the globally installed libraries either).\n\n\nYou can install the software if you want at the system level if you have\nroot privileges, however this may lead to broken dependencies in the OS\nfor all your Python packages, so if possible, avoid this solution and\nuse the \nvirtualenv\n solution.\n\n\nInstalling \nvirtualenv\n in the\nUbuntu server could be done like this:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install python-virtualenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter installing the software, now you will be able to create\nindependent virtual environments for the PYBOSSA installation as well as\nfor the template projects (see user/tutorial).\n\n\nInstalling the PYBOSSA Python requirements\n\n\nInstalling the required libraries for PYBOSSA is a step that will need\nto use some compilers and dev libraries in order to work. Thus, you will\nneed to install the following packages:\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo apt-get install python-dev build-essential libjpeg-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev\nsudo apt-get install dbus libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you are ready to download the code and install the required\nlibraries for running PYBOSSA.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe recommend you to install the required libraries using a \nvirtual environment\n with the command virtualenv (you can install the package\npython-virtualenv). This will allow to have all the libraries for\nPYBOSSA in one folder of your choice, so cleaning the installation\nwould be as simple as deleting that folder without affecting your\nsystem.\n\n\n\n\nIf you decide to use a \nvirtualenv\n then, follow these steps (lines\nstarting with \n#\n are comments):\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n# get the source code\n\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa\n\n# Access the source code folder\n\n\ncd\n pybossa\nvirtualenv env\n\n# Activate the virtual environment\n\n\nsource\n env/bin/activate\n\n# Upgrade pip to latest version\n\npip install -U pip\n\n# Install the required libraries\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise you should be able to install the libraries in your system\nlike this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n# get the source\n\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa\n\n# Access the source code folder\n\n\ncd\n pybossa\n\n# Upgrade pip to latest version\n\npip install -U pip\n\n# Install the required libraries\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nVim\n editor is a very popular text editor in GNU/Linux systems, however it\nmay be difficult for some people if you have never used it before.\nThus, if you want to try another and much simpler editor for editing\nthe configuration files you can use the \nGNU\nNano\n editor.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a settings file and enter your SQLAlchemy DB URI (you can also\noverride default settings as needed):\n\n\n1\n2\n3\ncp settings_local.py.tmpl settings_local.py\n\n# now edit ...\n\nvim settings_local.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAlternatively, if you want your config elsewhere or with different name:\ncp settings_local.py.tmpl {/my/config/file/somewhere}\nexport PYBOSSA_SETTINGS={/my/config/file/somewhere}\n\n\n\n\nCreate the alembic config file and set the sqlalchemy.url to point to\nyour database:\n\n\n1\n2\n    cp alembic.ini.template alembic.ini\n    \n# now set the sqlalchemy.url ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Redis\n\n\nSince version v0.2.1, PYBOSSA uses Redis not only for caching objects\nand speed up the site, but also for limiting the usage of the API\nrequests.\n\n\nLatest Redis can be installed by downloading the package directly from\nits official \nRedis\n site. Since Ubuntu 14.04 you can\nalso use the internal package:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded it, and installed it, you will need to run two\ninstances:\n\n\n\n\nRedis-server\n: as a master node, accepting read and write\n  operations.\n\n\nRedis-sentinel\n: as a sentinel node, to configure the master and\n  slave Redis nodes.\n\n\n\n\nServer\n\n\nIf you have installed the server via your distribution package system,\nthen, the server will be running already. If this is not the case, check\nthe official documentation of \nRedis\n to configure it\nand run it. The default values should be fine.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease, make sure that you are running version \n= 2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you have installed the software using the source code, then, check the\ncontrib folder, as there is a specific folder for Redis with init.d\nstart scripts. You only have to copy that file to /etc/init.d/ and\nadapt it to your needs.\n\n\n\n\nSentinel\n\n\nRedis can be run in sentinel mode with the \nsentinel\n arg, or by its\nown command named: redis-sentinel. This will vary from your distribution\nand version of Redis, so check its help page to know how you can run it.\n\n\nIn any case, you will need to run a sentinel node, as PYBOSSA uses it to\nload-balance the queries, and also to autoconfigure the master and\nslaves automagically.\n\n\nIn order to run PYBOSSA, you will need first to configure a Sentinel\nnode. Create a config file named \nsentinel.conf\n with something like\nthis:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nsentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2\nsentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 60000\nsentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000\nsentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the contrib folder you will find a file named \nsentinel.conf\n that\nshould be enough to run the sentinel node. Thus, for running it:\n\n\n1\nredis-server contrib/sentinel.conf --sentinel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease, make sure that you are running version \n= 2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you have installed the software using the source code, then, check the\ncontrib folder, as there is a specific folder for Redis with init.d\nstart scripts. You only have to copy that file to /etc/init.d/ and\nadapt it to your needs.\n\n\n\n\nSpeeding up the site\n\n\nEnabling the cache\n\n\nPYBOSSA comes with a Cache system that it is enabled by default. PYBOSSA\nuses a \nRedis\n server to cache some objects like\nprojects, statistics, etc. The system uses the\n\nSentinel\n feature of\n\nRedis\n, so you can have several master/slave nodes\nconfigured with \nSentinel\n, and your\nPYBOSSA server will use them \nautomagically\n.\n\n\nOnce you have started your master Redis-server to accept connections,\nSentinel will manage it and its slaves. If you add a slave, Sentinel\nwill find it and start using it for load-balancing queries in PYBOSSA\nCache system.\n\n\nFor more details about \nRedis\n and\n\nSentinel\n, please, read the official\n\ndocumentation\n.\n\n\nIf you want to disable it, you can do it with an environment variable:\n\n\n1\nexport\n \nPYBOSSA_REDIS_CACHE_DISABLED\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen start the server, and nothing will be cached.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nWe highly recommend you to not disable the cache, as it\nwill boost the performance of the server caching SQL queries as well as\npage views. If you have lots of projects with hundreds of tasks, you\nshould enable it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nSometimes Redis is a bit outdated in your Linux\ndistribution. If this is the case, you will need to install it by hand,\nbut it is really easy and well documented in the official\n\nRedis\n site.\n\n\n\n\nRunning asynchronous tasks in the background\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the Python libraries \nRQ\n and\n\nRQScheduler\n to allow slow or\ncomputationally-heavy tasks to be run in the background in an\nasynchronous way.\n\n\nSome of the tasks are run in a periodic, scheduled, basis, like the\nrefreshment of the cache and notifications sent to users, while others,\nlike the sending of mails are created in real time, responding to events\nthat may happen inside the PYBOSSA server, like sending an email with a\nrecovery password.\n\n\nTo allow all this, you will need two additional Python processes to run\nin the background: the \nworker\n and the \nscheduler\n. The scheduler\nwill create the periodic tasks while other tasks will be created\ndynamically. The worker will execute every of them.\n\n\nTo run the scheduler, just run the following command in a console:\n\n\n1\nrqscheduler --host IP-of-your-redis-master-node\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, to get the tasks done by the worker, run:\n\n\n1\npython app_context_rqworker.py scheduled_jobs super high medium low email maintenance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also recommended the use of \nsupervisor\n\nfor running these processes in an easier way and with a single command.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhile the execution of the scheduler is optional (you will not have the\nimprovements in performance given by them, but you may also not need\nthem), the execution of the worker is mandatory for the normal\nfunctioning of the PYBOSSA server, so make sure you run the command\nfor it.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the DataBase\n\n\nYou need first to add a user to your \nPostgreSQL\n DB:\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo su postgres\ncreateuser -d -P pybossa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse password \ntester\n when prompted.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou should use the same user name that you have used in the\nsettings_local.py and alembic.ini files.\n\n\n\n\nAfter running the last command, you maybe also have to answer to these\nquestions:\n\n\n\n\nShall the new role be a super user? Answer \nn\n (press the \nn\n\n  key).\n\n\nShall the new role be allowed to create databases? Answer \ny\n\n  (press the \ny\n key).\n\n\nShall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? Answer \nn\n\n  (press the \nn\n key).\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, you can create the database:\n\n\n1\ncreatedb pybossa -O pybossa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, exit the postgresql user:\n\n\n1\nexit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, populate the database with its tables:\n\n\n1\npython cli.py db_create\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the web server:\n\n1\npython run.py\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in your web browser the following URL: \nhttp://localhost:5000\n\n\nAnd if you see the following home page, then, your installation has been\ncompleted:\n\n\n\n\nUpdating PYBOSSA\n\n\nUpdate PYBOSSA core and migrating the database table structure\n\n\nSometimes, the PYBOSSA developers add a new column or table to the\nPYBOSSA server, forcing you to carry out a \nmigration\n of the\ndatabase. PYBOSSA uses \nAlembic\n\nfor performing the migrations, so in case that your production server\nneed to upgrade the DB structure to a new version, all you have to do is\nto:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\ngit pull origin master\npip install -U pip\npip install -U -r requirements.txt\nalembic upgrade head\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first command will get you the latest source code. Then new\nlibraries are installed or upgraded. And Alembic is upgrading the\ndatabase structure.\n\n\nVery occasionally, updates to the core code will also required\n\npybossa.js\n to be updated in\nyour PYBOSSA theme. To update the default theme you can to this:\n\n\n1\n2\ncd\n home/pybossa/pybossa/themes/default\ngit pull origin master\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using the \nvirtualenv\n be sure to activate it before running the\n\nAlembic\n upgrade command.\n\n\n\n\nMigrating Your Old DB Records\n\n\nIn versions prior to v0.2.3, HTML was supported as the default option\nfor the \nlong_description\n field in projects. In new versions of\nPYBOSSA, Markdown has been adopted as the default option. However, you\ncan use HTML instead of Markdown by modifying the default PYBOSSA theme\nor using your own forked from the default one.\n\n\nIf you were have been using PYBOSSA for a while you may have projects in\nyour database whose \nlong_description\n is in HTML format. Hence, if you\nare using the default theme for PYBOSSA you will no longer see them\nrendered as HTML and may have some issues.\n\n\nIn order to avoid this, you can run a simple script to convert all the\nDB project\ns \nlong_description\n field from HTML to Markdown, just by\nrunning the following commands:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\npip install -U pip\npip install -U -r requirements.txt\npython cli.py markdown_db_migrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first command will install a Python package that will handle the\nHTML to Markdown conversion, while the second one will convert your DB\nentries.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs always, if you are using the \nvirtualenv\n be sure to activate it before\nrunning the pip install command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe latest version of PYBOSSA requires PostgreSQL \n= 9.3 as it is using materialized\nviews for the dashboard. This feature is only available from\nPostgreSQL 9.3, so please upgrade the DB as soon as possible. For\nmore information about upgrading the PostgreSQL database check this\n\npage\n.",

If you decide to use a  virtualenv  then, follow these steps (lines\nstarting with  #  are comments):   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11 # get the source code \ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa # Access the source code folder  cd  pybossa\nvirtualenv env # Activate the virtual environment  source  env/bin/activate # Upgrade pip to latest version \npip install -U pip # Install the required libraries \npip install -r requirements.txt   Otherwise you should be able to install the libraries in your system\nlike this:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 # get the source \ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa # Access the source code folder  cd  pybossa # Upgrade pip to latest version \npip install -U pip # Install the required libraries \npip install -r requirements.txt    Note  Vim  editor is a very popular text editor in GNU/Linux systems, however it\nmay be difficult for some people if you have never used it before.\nThus, if you want to try another and much simpler editor for editing\nthe configuration files you can use the  GNU\nNano  editor.   Create a settings file and enter your SQLAlchemy DB URI (you can also\noverride default settings as needed):  1\n2\n3 cp settings_local.py.tmpl settings_local.py # now edit ... \nvim settings_local.py    Note  Alternatively, if you want your config elsewhere or with different name:\ncp settings_local.py.tmpl {/my/config/file/somewhere}\nexport PYBOSSA_SETTINGS={/my/config/file/somewhere}   Create the alembic config file and set the sqlalchemy.url to point to\nyour database:  1\n2     cp alembic.ini.template alembic.ini\n     # now set the sqlalchemy.url ...",

If you\nwant to run also other services on the same server you need to modify\nthe nginx config files!\n\n\nYou have to copy and adapt the following files from your local PYBOSSA\ninstallation:\n\n\n\n\ncontrib/nginx/pybossa\n\n\ncontrib/pybossa.ini\n\n\n\n\nThe PYBOSSA virtual host file (\ncontrib/nginx/pybossa\n) has the\nfollowing directives:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nlocation\n \n/\n \n{\n \ntry_files\n \n$uri\n \n@pybossa\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\nlocation\n \n@\npybossa\n \n{\n\n    \ninclude\n \nuwsgi_params\n;\n\n    \nuwsgi_pass\n \nunix\n:/\ntmp\n/\npybossa\n.\nsock\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nlocation\n  \n/\nstatic\n \n{\n\n\n            \n#\n \nchange\n \nthat\n \nto\n \nyour\n \npybossa\n \nstatic\n \ndirectory\n\n            \nalias\n \n/home/Scifabric/pybossa/pybossa/themes/default/static\n;\n\n\n            \nautoindex\n \non\n;\n\n            \nexpires\n \nmax\n;\n\n        \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify a user and group from your machine with lower privileges\nin order to improve the security of the site. You can also use the\nwww-data user and group name.\n\n\nOnce you have adapted the PATH in the alias in that file, copy it into\nthe folder:\n\n\n1\nsudo cp contrib/nginx/pybossa /etc/nginx/sites-available/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease delete the default config in sites-enabled (do not worry there is\na backup):\n\n\n1\nsudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the PYBOSSA site:\n\n1\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pybossa /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pybossa\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd restart the server:\n\n1\nsudo service nginx restart\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the pybossa.ini file for uwsgi\n\n\nYou have to copy the \npybossa.ini.template\n file to pybossa.ini in\nyour PYBOSSA installation and adapt the paths to match your\nconfiguration!\n\n\nThe content of this file is the following:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n[\nuwsgi\n]\n\n\nsocket\n \n=\n \n/\ntmp\n/\npybossa\n.\nsock\n\n\nchmod\n-\nsocket\n \n=\n \n666\n\n\nchdir\n \n=\n \n/\nhome\n/\npybossa\n/\npybossa\n\n\npythonpath\n \n=\n \n..\n\n\nvirtualenv\n \n=\n \n/\nhome\n/\npybossa\n/\npybossa\n/\nenv\n\n\nmodule\n \n=\n \nrun\n:\napp\n\n\ncpu\n-\naffinity\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nprocesses\n \n=\n \n2\n\n\nthreads\n \n=\n \n2\n\n\nstats\n \n=\n \n/\ntmp\n/\npybossa\n-\nstats\n.\nsock\n\n\nbuffer\n-\nsize\n \n=\n \n65535\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall supervisord\n\n\nSupervisord is used to let PYBOSSA and its RQ system run as Daemon in\nthe background. It shares some of the same goals of programs like\nlaunchd, daemontools, and runit.\n\n\nInstall it:\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Redis and sentinel as service with supervisord\n\n\nFirst stop redis service and all running redis instances with:\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo service redis-server stop\nkillall redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to run redis and sentinel with supervisord because supervisord\nis more reliable when redis crashes (which can happen when you have too\nless memory). So we disable redis-server daemon service with:\n\n\n1\nsudo rm /etc/init.d/redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to your pybossa installation directory and copy following files:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/redis-server.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/redis-sentinel.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/\nsudo cp contrib/redis-supervisor/redis.conf /etc/redis/\nsudo cp contrib/redis-supervisor/sentinel.conf /etc/redis/\nsudo chown redis:redis /etc/redis/redis.conf\nsudo chown redis:redis /etc/redis/sentinel.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we restart supervisord (please do a full stop and start as\ndescribed):\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo service supervisor stop\nsudo service supervisor start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo verify install you can list all redis processes and you should see a\nredis-server at port 6379 and redis-sentinel at port 26379:\n\n\n1\nps aux \n|\n grep redis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis two services will no run whenever the server is running (even after\nreboot).\n\n\nConfigure RQ-Scheduler and -Worker to run with supervisord\n\n\nYou need to adjust the paths and user account in this two config files\naccording to your installation! Then copy them to supervisor (do not\nforget to edit them):\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/rq-scheduler.conf.template /etc/supervisor/conf.d/rq-scheduler.conf\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/rq-worker.conf.template /etc/supervisor/conf.d/rq-worker.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart supervisor fully:\n\n1\n2\nsudo service supervisor stop\nsudo service supervisor start\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify service running. You should see a rqworker and rqscheduler\ninstance in console:\n\n\n1\nps aux \n|\n grep rq\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup PYBOSSA itself\n\n\nThis steps are recommended to do when you run PYBOSSA in nginx. Open\nyour \nsettings_local.py\n in your PYBOSSA installation and uncomment\nor delete the two lines with \nHOST\n and \nPORT\n, e.g.:\n\n\n1\n2\n# HOST = \n0.0.0.0\n\n\n# PORT = 12000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter that specify the full server URL where your PYBOSSA is reachable,\ne.g.:\n\n\n1\n2\nSERVER_NAME\n \n=\n \nmypybossa\n.\ncom\n\n\nPORT\n \n=\n \n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet PYBOSSA run as service\n\n\nFinally we need to let pybossa run as service. Adjust again the paths\nand user name in this file and copy it to supervisor config directory:\n\n\n1\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/pybossa.conf.template /etc/supervisor/conf.d/pybossa.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit now the file and adjust paths \n user name.\n\n\nRestart supervisor fully:\n\n1\n2\nsudo service supervisor stop\nsudo service supervisor start\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have a running PYBOSSA production ready webserver on your\nnginx.

            "text": "Quickstart: Creating a Project\n\n\nThis is a short guide about how you can create a project in a PYBOSSA\nserver. Readers may wish to start with the\nStep by step tutorial on creating an\nProject \ntutorial\n which walks through creating a simple photo\nclassification project if they want to understand all the details about\nhow you create a project.\n\n\nFirst of all we have to create a project for the project. A project\nrepresents a set of tasks that have to be resolved by people, so a\nproject will have the following items:\n\n\n\n\nName\n,\n\n\nShort name\n or \nslug\n, and\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nThe \nslug\n or \nshort name\n is a shortcut for accessing the project\nvia the web (short urls like this \nhttp://domain.com/project/slug\n).\n\n\nThe \ndescription\n is a short sentence that will be used to describe\nyour project (think about it like a Tweet long description).\n\n\nA project can be created using two different methods:\n\n\n\n\nweb-interface, or\n\n\napi-interface.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Web Interface\n\n\nCreating a project using the web interface involves four steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreating the project,\n\n\nImport the tasks using the \nsimple built-in\n task-creator (uploading\n   a CSV file or Google Spreadsheet link exported as CSV),\n\n\nWrite the task-presenter for the users, and\n\n\nPublish the project.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the project\n\n\nIn order to create a project in PYBOSSA via the web interface you have\nto:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a local account in your PYBOSSA server:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother alternative is to use your Twitter, Facebook and Google sign in\nmethods, (if the server has enabled them, see the \ndocumentation\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have an account, click in \ncreate\n link of the top bar.\n\n\nAfter clicking in the previous button, you will have to fill in a\n   form with the very basic to create your project:\n\n\nName\n: the full name of your project, i.e. \nFlickr Person\n    Finder\n.\n\n\nShort Name\n: the \nslug\n or short name used in the URL for\n    accessing your project, i.e. \nflickrperson\n.\n\n\nLong Description\n: A \nlong\n description where you can use\n    Markdown to format the description of your project. This field\n    is usually used to provide information about the project, the\n    developer, the researcher group or institutions involved in the\n    project, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA usually provides two Categories by default: \nthinking\n and\n\nsensing\n. The \nthinking\n category represents the standard PYBOSSA\nproject where users contribute helping with their skills. \nSensing\n\ncategory refers to projects that are using a volunter sensing tools\nlike EpiCollect or Raspberry Pi with PYBOSSA for gathering data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have filled all the fields, click in the \nCreate the\n   project\n button, and you will have created your first project.\n\n\n\n\nAfter creating the project, you should be redirected to the \nSettings\n\nproject page, where you will be able to customize your project by adding\nsome extra information or changing some settings. There, you will find a\nform with the same fields as in the previous step (just in case you\nve\nchanged your mind and wanted to change any of them) plus the following:\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A \nshort\n description of the project, e.g. \nA\n   project to classify cancer cells\n. By default, it will have been\n   autogenerated for you from the \nLong description\n you filled in\n   the previous step (but without the Markdown!).\n\n\nAllow Anonymous Contributors\n: By default anonymous and\n   authenticated users can participate in all the projects, however you\n   can change it to only allow authenticated volunteers to participate.\n\n\nPassword\n: If you want to control who can contribute or access to\n   your project, you can set a password here to share with those you\n   allow to do it. If you leave it blank, then no password will protect\n   your project.\n\n\nCategory\n: Select a category that fits your project. categories\n   are added and managed by the server administrators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn addition, you will be able to select and upload an \nimage\n from your\nlocal computer to set it as the project image thoroughout the\nserver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks via the built-in CSV Task Importer\n\n\nTasks can be imported from a CSV file or a Google Spreadsheet via the\nsimple built-in task-creator. You have to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page (you can directly access it using\n   the \nslug\n project name: \nhttp://server/project/slug\n).\n\n\nClick in the \nTasks\n section -on the left side local navigation\n   menu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd click again on the \nImport Tasks\n card. After clicking on it you will\n   see several options. The first ones are for using the different\n   kinds of importers supported by PYBOSSA: Amazon S3, Twitter,\n   Dropbox, Flickr, Youtube, Google Spreadsheet, CSV url, and\n   EpiCollect Plus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the Flickr importer will allow to import a Flickr album by\ntyping its ID or if you have an account, by logging into Flickr and\nshowing your own public (and creative commons licensed) albums:\n\n\n \n\n\nSelect one of the albums, click import and all the pictures will be\nimported as tasks for your PYBOSSA project. As simple as that.\n\n\nThe other importers are very similar. In most cases you\nll provide a URL\nto the resource, like for the CSV and Google Spreadhseet importer, while\nthe Dropbox, Amazon S3, Twitter, Youtube, and EpiCollect Plus importers\nwill have a nice interface to importa data automagically for you.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you\nre trying to import from a Google Spreadsheet, ensure the file is\naccessible to everyone via the Share option, choosing: \nPublic on the\nweb - Anyone on the Internet can find and view\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYour spreadsheet/CSV file must contain a header row. All the fields in\nthe CSV will be serialized to JSON and stored in the \ninfo\n field. If\nyour field name is one of \nstate\n, \nquorum\n, \ncalibration\n,\n\npriority_0\n, or \nn_answers\n, it will be saved in the respective\ncolumns. Your spreadsheet must be visible to public or everyone with\nURL.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Task Importer section, you\nll find also other pre-loaded with\nGoogle Spreadsheets URLs. Those templates are examples that you can use\nto learn how to create your own spreadsheets and import data for image,\nsound, video, pdf mining and mapping projects.\n\n\n\n\nBy using these templates, you\nll be able to learn the structure of the\ntasks, and directly re-use the task-presenter templates that know the\nstructure (name of the columns) for presenting the task.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can re-use the templates by downloading the CSV files\nfrom Google Docs, or even copying them to your own Google Drive account\n(click in \nFile\n -\n \nMake a copy\n in the Google Doc Spreadsheet). The\navailable templates are the following:\n\n\n\n\nImage Pattern\n  Recognition\n\n\nSound Pattern\n  Recognition\n\n\nVideo Pattern\n  Recognition\n\n\nGeo-coding\n\n  and\n\n\nPDF\n  transcription\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you import again the same URL, only new records will be added to the\nproject.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from an EpiCollect Plus Public Project\n\n\nEpiCollect\n provides a web project for the\ngeneration of forms and freely hosted project websites (using Google\ns\nAppEngine) for many kinds of mobile data collection projects.\n\n\nData can be collected using multiple mobile phones running either the\nAndroid Operating system or the iPhone (using the EpiCollect mobile app)\nand all data can be synchronised from the phones and viewed centrally\n(using Google Maps) via the Project website or directly on the phones.\n\n\nEpiCollect\n can help you to recollect data\nsamples according to a form that could include multimedia like photos.\nMoreover, \nEpiCollect\n can geolocate the\ndata sample as it supports the built-in GPS that all modern smartphones\nhave.\n\n\nFor example, you can create an \nEpiCollect\n\nproject where the form will ask the user to take a picture of a lake,\ngeo-locate it automatically via the smartphone built-in GPS and upload\nthe picture to the \nEpiCollect\n server. If\nthe user does not have Internet access at that moment, the user will be\nable to synchronize the data afterwards i.e. when the user has access to\nan Internet WIFI hotspot.\n\n\nPYBOSSA can automatically import data from a public\n\nEpiCollect\n Plus project that you own or\nthat it is publicly available in the\n\nEpiCollect\n web site and help you to\nvalidate, analyze, etc. the data that have been obtained via EpiCollect.\n\n\nIf you want to import the data points submitted to a \npublic\n\n\nEpiCollect\n project, you will have to\nfollow the next steps:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page (you can directly access it using\n   the \nslug\n project name: \nhttp://server/project/slug\n).\n\n\nClick in the \nTasks\n section -on the left side local navigation\n   menu:\n\n\n\n\nAnd click on the \nImport Tasks\n button. After clicking on it you\n   will see several different options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick in the \nUse an EpiCollect Project\n one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, type the \nname of the EpiCollect project\n and the name of\n   the \nform\n that you want to import, and click in the import button.\n\n\n\n\nAll the data points should be imported now in your project.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEpiCollect projects will be gathering data mostly all the time, for this\nreason, if you import again the same EpiCollect project, only \nnew\ndata points\n will be imported. This feature will allow you to\neasily add new data points to the PYBOSSA project without having to\ndo anything special.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from a Flickr photo set\n\n\nPYBOSSA also allows to import tasks for projects based on images (like\nimage pattern recognition ones) directly from a\n\nFlickr\n\n\nset\n (also called\nalbum).\n\n\nWhen importing tasks from a Flickr set, a new task will be created for\neach of the photos in the specified set. The tasks will include the\nfollowing data about each picture (which will be later available to be\nused in the task presenter):\n\n\n\n\ntitle: the title of the photograph, as it appears on Flickr.\n\n\nurl: the url to the raw .jpg image, in its original size.\n\n\nurl_b: the url to the image, \nbig sized.\n\n\nurl_m: the url to the image, \nmedium\n sized.\n\n\nlink: a link to the photo page in flickr (not to the raw image).\n\n\n\n\nYou can import tasks from a Flickr photo set (a.k.a. album) in either of\nthe following ways:\n\n\nThe easiest one is to give the PYBOSSA server permission to access your\nFlickr list of albums. To do so, you\nll have to log in to your Flickr\naccount by clicking the \nLog in Flickr\n button. Then you\nll be\nredirected to Flickr, where you will be asked if you want to allow\nPYBOSSA to access your Flickr information. If you say yes, then you\nll\nbe again redirected to PYBOSSA and you\nll see all of your albums. Choose\none of them and then click the \nImport\n button to get all the photos\ncreated as tasks for your project.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNext time you try to import photos using the Flickr importer, you\nll see\nthe albums for your account again. If you don\nt want PYBOSSA to\naccess them anymore, or just want to use another Flickr account,\nthen click \nRevoke access\n.\n\n\n\n\nAnother option to import from a Flickr album is by specifying the ID of\nthe set (album) directly. This option is a bit more advanced (don\nt be\nafraid, it is still very easy if you follow the next steps) and it\nallows you to import from a photo set that you don\nt own (although, it\nwill have to be public. Also check the rights of the photos on it!).\nAnother advantage is that you don\nt need to log in to Flickr, sou you\ndon\nt even need to have a Flickr account.\n\n\nThese are the steps:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page and click in the \nTasks\n section:\n\n\nThen click on the \nImport Tasks\n button, and select the \nFlickr\n   importer\n:\n\n\nLog in with your Flickr ID and select one of the available albums of\n   your account, or type the ID of the Flickr set you want to import\n   the photos from, then click on the import button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you cannot find the ID or don\nt know what it is, just browse to your\nFlickr photo set and check the URL. Can you see that last long number\nrigth at the end of it? That\ns what you\nre looking for!\n\n\n :width: 100%\n\n\nAnd all the photos will be imported to your project. Just like with the\nother importers, each task will be created only once, even if you import\ntwice from the same Flickr set (unless you add new photos to it, of\ncourse!).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou will need to make sure that every photo belonging to the set has the\nvisibility set to public, so the PYBOSSA server can then access and\npresent them to the volunteers of your project.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from a Dropbox account\n\n\nYou can import tasks from arbitrary data hosted on a Dropbox account\nwith the Dropbox importer. When importer tasks like this, the following\ninformation will be added to the info field of each tasks, available\nlater to be used in the task presenter of the project:\n\n\n\n\nfilename: just it, the name of the file you\nre importing as a task.\n\n\nlink: the link to the Dropbox page showing the file.\n\n\nlink_raw: the link to the raw file served by Dropbox. This is the\n  one you\nll have to use if you want to direct link to the file from\n  the presenter (e.g. for using an image in a \n tag, you\nd\n  do: \n).\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this generic information, the Dropbox importer will also\nrecognize some kind of files by their extension and will attach some\nextra information to them.\n\n\nFor pdf files (.pdf extension), the following field will be obtained\ntoo:\n\n\n\n\npdf_url: direct link to the raw pdf file, with CORS support.\n\n\n\n\nFor image files (.png, jpg, .jpeg and .gif extensions) the following\ndata will be available:\n\n\n\n\nurl_m: the same as link_raw\n\n\nurl_b: the same as link_raw\n\n\ntitle: the same as filename\n\n\n\n\nFor audio files (.mp4, .m4a, .mp3, .ogg, .oga, .webm and .wav\nextensions):\n\n\n\n\naudio_url: raw link to the audio file, which can be used inside an\n  HTML 5 \naudio\n tag and supports CORS.\n\n\n\n\nFor video files (.mp4, .m4v, .ogg, .ogv, .webm and .avi extensions):\n\n\n\n\naudio_url: raw link to the video file, which can be used inside an\n  HTML 5 \nvideo\n tag and supports CORS.\n\n\n\n\nThe tasks created with the Dropbox importer are ready to be used with\nthe template project presenters available in PYBOSSA, as they include\nthe described fields.\n\n\nThus, importing your images from Dropbox will allow you to immediately\nuse the image pattern recognition template with them; importing videos,\naudio files or pdfs with the Dropbox importer will also grant you to use\nthe presenter templates for video pattern recognition, sound pattern\nrecognition or documents transcription, respectively, with no additional\nmodifications and have them working right away (as long as the files\nhave any of the mentioned file extensions, of course).\n\n\nThese are the steps:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page and click in the \nTasks\n section:\n\n\nThen click on the \nImport Tasks\n button, and select the \nDropbox\n   importer\n:\n\n\nClick on the \nChoose from Dropbox\n icon. You will be asked your\n   Dropbox account credentials. then select as many files as you want:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can repeat step 3 as many times as you want, and more files will\n   be added to your import. Then, click on \nImport\n.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from a Twitter account or search result\n\n\nAnother option for importing tasks is using the built-in Twitter\nimporter. It allows to import tweets as tasks from either a specified\nTwitter user account, or from the results returned from a search to the\nTwitter search API.\n\n\nTasks imported with it will have the tweet data attached to their info\nfield, and can later be used from within the task presenter. This data\nis a direct transcription of the data returned by the Twitter API, in\nparticular a \nTweet\n\nobject.\n\n\nPlease notice that the values returned by the Twitter API may vary.\nHowever, the following fields are guaranteed to be always included in\nthe info field of the tasks:\n\n\n\n\ncreated_at: the date and time the tweet was made.\n\n\nfavorite_count: number of times the tweet has been marked as\n  \nfavorite\n.\n\n\nretweet_count: number of times the tweet has been retweeted.\n\n\ncoordinates: geographic coordinates of the place the tweet was made\n  from. Note that this is not always available for every tweet.\n\n\ntweet_id: the internal ID handled by Twitter to identify this\n  tweet.\n\n\nuser: an \nobject\n with\n  information about the tweet author, as returned by the Twitter API.\n\n\ntext: the actual content of the tweet.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, an extra field \nuser_screen_name\n has been added to the\ninfo field:\n\n\n\n\nuser_screen_name: the screen name (or \nhandle\n) of the author of\n  the tweet.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, please refer to the \nTwitter\n documentation. \n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nWhen importing tweets from a search, retweets will be ignored!\n\n\n\n\nSo, to import tasks with the Twitter importer, do as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page and click in the \nTasks\n section:\n\n\nThen click on the \nImport Tasks\n button, and select the \nTwitter\n   importer\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou can provide your own Twitter credentials and make API requests\n   in behalf of them, or use the credentials provided by us. (The later\n   only allows to import the number of tweets returned by a single\n   Twitter API call, which is 100 for searches and 200 for user\n   timelines.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the two fields you will find in the form. The first one is\n   for the source of your tweets. If you want them to be imported from a\n   user account, then write it with the \n@\n symbol, like \n@PYBOSSA\n. If you\n   just want to import tweets containing a word on them (or a #hashtag),\n   then type it there. The second field is for you to specify how many\n   tweets you want to import. You can import as many as you want!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, click on the \nImport\n button, and you are done:\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from an Amazon S3 bucket\n\n\nTasks can be imported from data hosted on the Amazon S3 service.\nSimilarly to the Dropbox importer, these tasks can use different kind of\ndata, like images, videos, audios, PDF files, etc. hosted on any S3\nbucket.\n\n\nThe S3 importer will work pretty much the same as the Dropbox one. When\nusing it, the created tasks will contain the following data in the info\nfield:\n\n\n\n\nfilename: just it, the name of the file you\nre importing as a task.\n\n\nlink: the link to the raw file served from Amazon S3.\n\n\nurl: same as the above.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this generic information, the S3 importer will also\nrecognize some kind of files by their extension and will attach some\nextra information to them.\n\n\nFor pdf files (.pdf extension), the following field will be obtained\ntoo:\n\n\n\n\npdf_url: direct link to the raw pdf file.\n\n\n\n\nFor image files (.png, jpg, .jpeg and .gif extensions) the following\ndata will be available:\n\n\n\n\nurl_m: the same as link.\n\n\nurl_b: the same as link.\n\n\ntitle: the same as filename.\n\n\n\n\nFor audio files (.mp4, .m4a, .mp3, .ogg, .oga, .webm and .wav\nextensions):\n\n\n\n\naudio_url: raw link to the audio file, which can be used inside an\n  HTML 5 \naudio\n tag.\n\n\n\n\nFor video files (.mp4, .m4v, .ogg, .ogv, .webm and .avi extensions):\n\n\n\n\naudio_url: raw link to the video file, which can be used inside an\n  HTML 5 \nvideo\n tag.\n\n\n\n\nThe tasks created with the S3 importer are ready to be used with the\ntemplate project presenters available in PYBOSSA, as they include the\ndescribed fields.\n\n\nThus, importing your images from S3 will allow you to immediately use\nthe image pattern recognition template with them; importing videos,\naudio files or pdfs with the S3 importer will also grant you to use the\npresenter templates for video pattern recognition, sound pattern\nrecognition or documents transcription, respectively, with no additional\nmodifications and have them working right away (as long as the files\nhave any of the mentioned file extensions, of course).\n\n\nImporting from an S3 bucket requires that the bucket visibility is set\nto \npublic\n so its content can be seen and listed by PYBOSSA. To make a\nbucket public, go to your AWS management console and select the S3\nservice. Then select the bucket you want to make public and click on\n\nProperties\n. Click on \nAdd more Permissions\n and add a new one with\n\nGrantee: Everyone\n and the \nList\n checkbox selected, like in the\nfollowing image:\n\n\n\n\nYou may also need to enable CORS in the bucket. In the same menu as\nabove, click on \nEdit CORS Configuration\n and configure it. You can\nlearn more \nhere\n.\n\n\nFinally, you need to make sure that every file inside the bucket that\nyou want to use in a task has a \npublic\n link too. Go to the bucket\ncontent and select the files. Then click on \nActions\n and select \nMake\nPublic\n. Your files will now be visible for everyone, including a\nPYBOSSA server.\n\n\n\n\nOnce your S3 bucket is ready, you can follow these steps to import tasks\nfrom it:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page and click in the \nTasks\n section:\n\n\n\n\nThen click on the \nImport Tasks\n button, and select the \nS3\n   importer\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType the name of the bucket from which you will be importing your\n   tasks and click on \nSearch in bucket\n. If you followed the steps above\n   and your bucket is public, you will see a list of the items it contains.\n   Select as many as you want:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you\nre ready, click on \nImport\n.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from Youtube\n\n\nTasks can be imported from Youtube. Currently the importer supports\nimporting from Youtube with:\n\n\n\n\nPlaylists\n\n\n\n\nWhen importing the video the importer parses all videos information and\ncreates tasks with info fields:\n\n\n\n\nvideo_url: the URL of the youtube video which can be embedded in\n  the task form.\n\n\noembed: embeddable code for the (old) PYBOSSA video templates.\n\n\n\n\nThe tasks created with the Youtube importer are ready to be used with\nthe youtube and video templates.\n\n\nFlushing all the tasks\n\n\nThe project settings gives you an option to automatically \ndelete all\nthe tasks and associated task runs\n from your project.\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\nThis action cannot be un-done, so please, be sure that you want to\nactually delete all the tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThis action will only allow you to delete tasks that are not\nassociated with a result. When a result is created, that task and its\ntask runs cannot be deleted so the volunteers can always have access to\ntheir contributions.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are sure that you want to flush all the tasks and task runs for\nyour project, go to the project page\n(http://server/project/slug/tasks/) and click in the \nSettings\n\noption of the left local navigation menu:\n\n\n\n\nThen, you will see that there is a sub section called: \nTask Settings\n\nand a button with the label: \nDelete the tasks\n. Click in that button\nand a new page will be shown:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, a \nred warning alert\n is shown, warning you that if\nyou click in the \nyes\n button, you will be deleting not only the\nproject tasks, but also the answers (task runs) that you have\nrecollected for your project. Be sure before proceeding that you want to\ndelete all the tasks. After clicking in the \nyes\n button, you will see\nthat all the tasks have been flushed.\n\n\nCreating the Task Presenter\n\n\nOnce you have the project and the tasks in the server, you can start\nworking with the task-presenter, which will be the web project that will\nget the tasks of your project, present them to the volunteer and save\nthe answers provided by the users.\n\n\nIf you have followed all the steps described in this section, you will\nbe already in the page of your project, however, if you are not, you\nonly need to access your project URL to work with your project. If your\nproject \nslug\n or \nshort name\n is \nflickrperson\n you will be able to\naccess the project managing options in this URL:\n\n\n1\nhttp://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/flickrperson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou need to be logged in, otherwise you will not be able to modify the\nproject.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way for accessing your project (or projects) is clicking in your\n\nuser name\n and select the \nMy Projects\n item from the drop down menu.\nFrom there you will be able to manage your projects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have chosen your project, you can add task-presenter by\nclicking in the \nTasks\n local navigation link, and then click in the\nbutton named \nEditor\n under the \nTask Presenter\n box.\n\n\n\n\nAfter clicking in this button, a new web page will be shown where you\ncan choose a template to start coding your project, so you don\nt have to\nactually start from scratch.\n\n\n\n\nAfter choosing one of the templates, you will be able to adapt it to fit\nyour project needs in a web text editor.\n\n\n\n\nClick in the \nPreview button\n to get an idea about how it will look\nlike your task-presenter.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend to read the Step by step tutorial on\ncreating a Project \ntutorial\n, as you will understand how to\ncreate the task presenter, which is basically adding some HTML skeleton\nto load the task data, input fields to get the answer of the users, and\nsome JavaScript to make it to work.\n\n\nPublishing the project\n\n\nAfter completing the previous three steps, your project will be almost\nready. The final step is to \npublish\n it, because now it will still be a\ndraft, and it will be hidden to everyone but you (and admins).\n\n\nWhen your project is a draft, you can contribute to it and the answers\n(task runs) and results will be stored in the database so you can have\naccess to them (and test the webhooks solution if you want to do\nreal-time analysis). However, in the moment of publishing the project\nall the task runs and results (as well as the webhooks log entries) will\nbe flushed, so don\nt be afraid and try it as much as you can until you\nare sure that everything works as expected. Once you think the project\nis ready for the world to see it, just click in the Publish button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPublishing a project \ncannot\n be undone, so please double check everything\nbefore taking the step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can allow other users to give you feedback and let them try and see your\nproject before it has been published. In order to do so, just\nprotect it with a password, and people will be able to access it (as\nlong as they have the password, of course).\n\n\n\n\nAfter publishing it, you will be able to access your project using the\nslug, or under your account in the \nPublished\n projects section:\n\n\nAlso, results will begin to be created every time a task is completed.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nUsing the API\n\n\nCreating a project using the API involves also four steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate the project,\n\n\nCreate the task-creator, and\n\n\nCreate the task-presenter for the users.\n\n\nPublish it. This needs to be done via the web interface. For more\n   details please refer to publishing.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the project\n\n\nYou can create a project via the API URL \n/api/project\n with a POST\nrequest (See api).\n\n\nYou have to provide the following information about the project and\nconvert it to a JSON object (the actual values are taken from the\n\nFlickr Person demo\nproject\n):\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nname\n \n=\n \nu\nFlickr\n \nPerson\n \nFinder\n\n\nshort_name\n \n=\n \nu\nFlickrPerson\n\n\ndescription\n \n=\n \nu\nDo\n \nyou\n \nsee\n \na\n \nhuman\n \nin\n \nthis\n \nphoto?\n\n\ninfo\n \n=\n \n{\n \ntask_presenter\n:\n \nu\ndiv\n \nSkeleton\n \nfor\n \nthe\n \ntasks\n/div\n \n}\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \ndict(name\n \n=\n \nname,\n \nshort_name\n \n=\n \nshort_name,\n \ndescription\n \n=\n \ndescription,\n \ninfo\n \n=\n \ninfo,\n \nhidden\n \n=\n \n0\n)\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \njson.dumps(data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlickr Person Finder, which is a \ndemo template\n that \nyou can\nre-use\n to create your own project, simplifies this step by using a\nsimple file named \nproject.json\n:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{\n\n\nname\n:\n \nFlickr Person Finder\n,\n\n\nshort_name\n:\n \nflickrperson\n,\n\n\ndescription\n:\n \nImage pattern recognition\n,\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file provides a basic configuration for your project.\n\n\nAdding tasks\n\n\nAs in all the previous steps, we are going to create a JSON object and\nPOST it using the following API URL \n/api/task\n in order to add tasks\nto a project that you own.\n\n\nFor PYBOSSA all the tasks are JSON objects with a field named \ninfo\n\nwhere the owners of the project can add any JSON object that will\nrepresent a task for their project. For example, using again the \nFlickr\nPerson demo project\n\nexample, we need to create a JSON object that should have the link to\nthe photo that we want to identify:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\ninfo\n \n=\n \ndict\n \n(\nlink\n=\nphoto\n[\nlink\n],\n \n             \nurl\n=\nphoto\n[\nurl_m\n],\n\n             \nquestion\n=\nDo you see a human face in this photo?\n)\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \ndict\n \n(\nproject_id\n=\nproject_id\n,\n\n             \nstate\n=\n0\n,\n\n             \ninfo\n=\ninfo\n,\n\n             \ncalibration\n=\n0\n,\n\n             \npriority_0\n=\n0\n)\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \njson\n.\ndumps\n(\ndata\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nurl_m\n is a pattern to describe the URL to the m medium size of the photo\nused by Flickr. It can be whatever you want, but as we are using\nFlickr we use the same patterns for storing the data.\n\n\n\n\nThe most important field for the task is the \ninfo\n one. This field\nwill be used to store a JSON object with the required data for the task.\nAs \nFlickr Person\n is\ntrying to figure out if there is a human or not in a photo, the provided\ninformation is:\n\n\n\n\nthe Flickr web page posting the photo, and\n\n\nthe direct URL to the image, the \n value.\n\n\n\n\nThe \ninfo\n field is a free-form field that can be populated with any\nstructure. If your project needs more fields, you can add them and use\nthe format that best fits your needs.\n\n\nThese steps are usually coded in the task-creator. The Flickr Person\nFinder projects provides a template for the task-creator that can be\nre-used without any problems.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe API request has to be authenticated and authorized\n. You can get\nan API-KEY creating an account in the server, and checking the API-KEY\ncreated for your user, check the profile account (click in your user\nname) and copy the field \nAPI-KEY\n.\n\n\nThis API-KEY should be passed as a POST argument like this with the\nprevious data:\n\n\n[POST] \nhttp://domain/api/task/?api_key=API-KEY\n\n\n\n\nOne of the benefits of using the API is that you can create tasks\npolling other web services like Flickr, where you can basically use an\nAPI. Once we have created the tasks, we will need to create the\ntask-presenter for the project.\n\n\nCreating the Task Presenter\n\n\nThe task-presenter is usually a template of HTML and JavaScript that\nwill present the tasks to the users, and save the answers in the\ndatabase. The \nFlickr Person demo\nproject\n provides a\nsimple template which has a \ndiv\n to load the input files, in this\ncase the photo, and another \ndiv\n to load the action buttons that\nthe users will be able to to press to answer the question and save it in\nthe database. Please, check the tutorial for more details about the\ntask-presenter.\n\n\nAs we will be using the API for creating the task presenter, we will\nbasically have to create an HTML file in our computer, read it from a\nscript, and post it into PYBOSSA using the API.\n\n\nOnce the presenter has been posted to the project, you can edit it\nlocally with your own editor, or using the PYBOSSA interface (see\nprevious section).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe API request has to be authenticated and authorized\n. You can get\nan API-KEY creating an account in the server, and checking the API-KEY\ncreated for your user, check the profile account (click in your user\nname) and copy the field \nAPI-KEY\n.\n\n\nThis API-KEY should be passed as a POST argument like this with the\nprevious data:\n\n\n[POST] \nhttp://domain/api/project/?api_key=API-KEY\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend to read the Step by step tutorial on\ncreating a Project \ntutorial\n, as you will understand how to\ncreate the task presenter, which is basically adding some HTML skeleton\nto load the task data, input fields to get the answer of the users, and\nsome JavaScript to make it work.\n\n\nUsing PYBOSSA API from the command line\n\n\nWhile you can use your own programming language to access the API we\nrecommend you to use the \nPYBOSSA pbs command line\ntool\n as it simpflies the usage of\nPYBOSSA for any given project.\n\n\nCreating a project is as simple as creating a project.json file and then\nrun the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs --server server --api-key yourkey create_project \n\n\n\n\nPlease, read the section \npbs\n for more details.",

Once you have an account, click in  create  link of the top bar.  After clicking in the previous button, you will have to fill in a\n   form with the very basic to create your project:  Name : the full name of your project, i.e.  Flickr Person\n    Finder .  Short Name : the  slug  or short name used in the URL for\n    accessing your project, i.e.  flickrperson .  Long Description : A  long  description where you can use\n    Markdown to format the description of your project. This field\n    is usually used to provide information about the project, the\n    developer, the researcher group or institutions involved in the\n    project, etc.       Note  PYBOSSA usually provides two Categories by default:  thinking  and sensing . The  thinking  category represents the standard PYBOSSA\nproject where users contribute helping with their skills.  Sensing \ncategory refers to projects that are using a volunter sensing tools\nlike EpiCollect or Raspberry Pi with PYBOSSA for gathering data.    Once you have filled all the fields, click in the  Create the\n   project  button, and you will have created your first project.

For example, the Flickr importer will allow to import a Flickr album by\ntyping its ID or if you have an account, by logging into Flickr and\nshowing your own public (and creative commons licensed) albums:     Select one of the albums, click import and all the pictures will be\nimported as tasks for your PYBOSSA project. As simple as that.  The other importers are very similar. In most cases you ll provide a URL\nto the resource, like for the CSV and Google Spreadhseet importer, while\nthe Dropbox, Amazon S3, Twitter, Youtube, and EpiCollect Plus importers\nwill have a nice interface to importa data automagically for you.   Note  If you re trying to import from a Google Spreadsheet, ensure the file is\naccessible to everyone via the Share option, choosing:  Public on the\nweb - Anyone on the Internet can find and view    Note  Your spreadsheet/CSV file must contain a header row.

When importing tasks from a Flickr set, a new task will be created for\neach of the photos in the specified set. The tasks will include the\nfollowing data about each picture (which will be later available to be\nused in the task presenter):   title: the title of the photograph, as it appears on Flickr.  url: the url to the raw .jpg image, in its original size.  url_b: the url to the image,  big sized.  url_m: the url to the image,  medium  sized.  link: a link to the photo page in flickr (not to the raw image).   You can import tasks from a Flickr photo set (a.k.a. album) in either of\nthe following ways:  The easiest one is to give the PYBOSSA server permission to access your\nFlickr list of albums. To do so, you ll have to log in to your Flickr\naccount by clicking the  Log in Flickr  button. Then you ll be\nredirected to Flickr, where you will be asked if you want to allow\nPYBOSSA to access your Flickr information. If you say yes, then you ll\nbe again redirected to PYBOSSA and you ll see all of your albums. Choose\none of them and then click the  Import  button to get all the photos\ncreated as tasks for your project.   Note  Next time you try to import photos using the Flickr importer, you ll see\nthe albums for your account again. If you don t want PYBOSSA to\naccess them anymore, or just want to use another Flickr account,\nthen click  Revoke access .   Another option to import from a Flickr album is by specifying the ID of\nthe set (album) directly. This option is a bit more advanced (don t be\nafraid, it is still very easy if you follow the next steps) and it\nallows you to import from a photo set that you don t own (although, it\nwill have to be public. Also check the rights of the photos on it!).\nAnother advantage is that you don t need to log in to Flickr, sou you\ndon t even need to have a Flickr account.  These are the steps:   Navigate to your project s page and click in the  Tasks  section:  Then click on the  Import Tasks  button, and select the  Flickr\n   importer :  Log in with your Flickr ID and select one of the available albums of\n   your account, or type the ID of the Flickr set you want to import\n   the photos from, then click on the import button:    If you cannot find the ID or don t know what it is, just browse to your\nFlickr photo set and check the URL. Can you see that last long number\nrigth at the end of it? That s what you re looking for!   :width: 100%  And all the photos will be imported to your project.

It\nallows you to create projects, add tasks (from a CSV or JSON file) with\na nice progress bar, delete them and update the project templates\n(tutorial, task_presenter, and descriptions) all from the command line.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\npbs is available in Pypi, so you can install the software with pip:\n\n\n1\npip install pybossa-pbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe recommend to use virtual environments to install new Python libraries\nand packages, so please, before installing the pbs command line tool\nconsider using a virtual environment.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have all the dependencies, the package will be installed and you\nwill be able to use it from the command line. The command is: \npbs\n.\n\n\nConfiguring pbs\n\n\nBy default, pbs does not need a config file, however you will have to\nspecify for every command the server and your API key in order to add\ntasks, create a project, etc, etc. For specifying the server and API key\nthat you want to use, all you have to do is pass it as an argument:\n\n\n1\npbs --server http://server.com --api-key yourkey subcommand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you work with two or more servers, then, remembering all the keys,\nand server urls could be problematic, as well as you will be leaving a\ntrace in your BASH history file. For this reason, pbs has a\nconfiguration file where you can add all the servers that you are\nworking with.\n\n\nTo create the config file, all you have to do is creating a\n\n.pybossa.cfg\n file in your home folder:\n\n\n1\n2\ncd\n ~\nvim .pybossa.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file should have the following structure:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n[\ndefault\n]\n\n\nserver\n:\n \nhttp\n:\n//\ntheserver\n.\ncom\n\n\napikey\n:\n \nyourkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are working with more servers, add another section below it.

However, if you want to\ndo actions in the other server, all you have to do is the following:\n\n\n1\npbs --credentials crowdcrafting --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat command will use the values of the crowdcrafting section.\n\n\nCreating a project\n\n\nCreating a project is very simple. All you have to do is create a file\nnamed \nproject.json\n with the following fields:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFlickr Person Finder\n,\n\n    \nshort_name\n:\n \nflickrperson\n,\n\n    \ndescription\n:\n \nImage pattern recognition\n,\n\n    \nquestion\n:\n \nDo you see a real human face in this photo?\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the name \nproject.json\n you will not have to pass the file\nname via an argument, as it\ns the named used by default. Once you have\nthe file created, run the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs create_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat command should create the project. If you want to see all the\navailable options, please check the \nhelp\n command:\n\n\n1\npbs create_project --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding tasks to a project\n\n\nAdding tasks is very simple. You can have your tasks in two formats:\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nCSV\n\n\nExcel\n\n\nPO file\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, adding tasks to your project is as simple as this command:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file tasks_file.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see all the available options, please check the\n\nhelp\n command:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA servers use a rate limit for avoiding abuse of the\nAPI. For this reason, you can only do usually 300 requests per every 15\nminutes. If you are going to add more than 300 tasks, pbs will detect it\nand warn you, auto-enabling the throttling for you to respect the\nlimits. Please, see rate-limiting for more details.\n\n\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating project templates\n\n\nNow that you have added tasks, you can work in your templates. All you\nhave to do to add/update the templates to your project is running the\nfollowing command:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat command needs to have in the same folder where you are running it,\nthe following files:\n\n\n\n\ntemplate.html\n\n\nresults.html\n\n\nlong_description.md\n\n\ntutorial.html\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use another template, you can via arguments:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project --template /tmp/template.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see all the available options, please check the\n\nhelp\n command:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeleting tasks from a project\n\n\nIf you need it, you can delete all the tasks from your project, or only\none using its task.id.

The page can be reached via the \nSettings\n menu, but\nalso from the \nTasks\n link in the left local navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\nThe page shows four different blocks:\n\n\n\n\nTask Scheduler\n: this block allows you to specify how the project\n   should send tasks to the volunteers.\n\n\nTask Priority\n: this block allows you to change the priority of\n   the tasks.\n\n\nTask Redundancy\n: use this block to change the default number of\n   answers (30 by default) that you want to obtain before marking a\n   task as completed.\n\n\nDelete Tasks\n: this final block allows you to flush all the tasks\n   and its associated task runs (answers).\n\n\n\n\nTask Scheduler\n\n\nPYBOSSA provides different task schedulers that will send tasks to the\nusers in very different ways.\n\n\n\n\nDefault or Depth First\n\n\nThe Default task scheduler (also known as Depth First) has the following\nfeatures:\n\n\n\n\nIt sends the tasks in the order that were created, first in first\n   out.\n\n\nUsers (anonymous and authenticated) will only be allowed to\n   participate once in the same task. Once a user has submitted a Task\n   Run (or answer) for a given task, the scheduler will never send that\n   task to the same user.\n\n\nIt will send the same task until the task-redundancy is achieved. In\n   other words, if a task has a redundancy value of 3, the task will be\n   always sent until those 3 answers have been submitted. Once the 3\n   answers have been collected, the task will be marked as \ncompleted\n\n   and it will not be sent again.\n\n\nWhen a user has submitted a Task Run for a given task, the scheduler\n   will send to the same user the next task.\n\n\nThis scheduler allows the usage of \norderby\n and \ndesc\n\n   arguments via the \napi/projectID/newtask\n endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, from the point of view of a user (authenticated or\nanonymous) the system will be sending the project tasks in the order\nthey were created. If the user tries to reload a task that he or she\nalready participated, the system will detect it, and warn the user\ngiving the option to try with another task (the scheduler will search\nfor the proper task for the given user).\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the project, the scheduler will be trying to\ncomplete (get all the answers requested by the task-redundancy value)\nall the tasks as soon as possible.\n\n\nBreadth First\n\n\nThe Breadth First scheduler has the following features:\n\n\n\n\nIt sends the tasks in the order that were created, first in first\n   out.\n\n\nIt sends always first the task with the least number of task runs in\n   the system.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, from the point of view of a user (authenticated or\nanonymous) the system will be sending the project\ns tasks that have less\nanswers (in case of not having an answer, the creation time will be used\nto send them like in a FIFO \nfirst in first out).\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the project, the scheduler will be trying to\nobtain as soon as possible an answer for all the available tasks.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you use the limit and offset, the tasks will be ordered first by the\nnumber of task runs, returning always first the tasks with less number\nof task runs for the user.\n\n\n\n\nRandom\n\n\nThe Random scheduler has the following features:\n\n\n\n\nIt sends a task randomly to the users.\n\n\nA user (authenticated or anonymous) can receive the same task two or\n   more times in a row.\n\n\nIt ignores the task-redundancy value, so tasks will be never marked\n   as \ncompleted\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, from the point of view of a user (authenticated or\nanonymous) the system will be sending tasks randomly as the user could\nreceive in a row the same task several times.\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the project, the scheduler will be sending\ntasks randomly.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBy using this scheduler, you may end up with some tasks that receive only\na few answers. If you want to avoid this issue, change to the other\ntwo schedulers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis scheduler is not enabled by default, as it comes as a plugin and its main\npurpose is to show how you can create your own scheduler using the\nplugin infrastructure. We do not recommend to use it in any\nproduction system, as users can participate several times in the\nsame task, making the statistical analysis useless.\n\n\n\n\nTask Priority\n\n\nPYBOSSA allows you to prioritize the tasks, or in other words, which\ntasks should be delivered first to the volunteers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nTask Priority is only respected by the default scheduler.\n\n\n\n\nThe page shows you two input boxes:\n\n\n\n\nTask IDs\n: comma separated Task IDs of your project tasks. Note:\n   not spaces between the values or commas.\n\n\nPriority\n: the priority that you want to set for the Task IDs.\n   This must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0.\n\n\n\n\nA task with a priority 1.0 will be the first Task to be delivered to a\ngiven user. In case that two or more tasks have the same priority value,\nthe first task that will be delivered will be the one with the lower\nTask.ID value.\n\n\nTask Redundancy\n\n\nThe Task Redundancy is a feature that will allow you to analyze\nstatistically the results that your project are getting for each of its\ntasks.\n\n\nPYBOSSA by default assigns a value of 30 task runs \nanswers\n per task,\nas this value is commonly used for analyzing the population\nstatistically.\n\n\nThis page will allow you to change the default value, 30, to whatever\nyou like between a minimum of 1 or a maximum of 10000 answers per task.\nWe recommend to have at use at least 3 answers per task, otherwise you\nwill not be able to run a proper analysis on a given task if two uses\nanswer different.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, imagine that the goal of the task is to answer if you see a\nhuman in a picture, and the available answers are Yes and No. If you set\nup the redundancy value to 2, and two different users answer\nrespectively Yes and No, you will not know the correct answer for the\ntask. By increasing the redundancy value to 5 (or even bigger) you will\nbe able to run a statistical analysis more accurately.\n\n\nDelete Tasks\n\n\nThis section will allow you to complete remove all the Tasks and\nassociated Task Runs (answers) of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis step cannot be undone, once you delete all the tasks and associated\ntask runs they will be lost forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nOnly tasks not associated with a result can be deleted.\n\n\n\n\nThis feature is useful when you are testing your project, and you are\ndeciding the structure that you are going to build in your answers.\n\n\nImport tasks automatically\n\n\nBoth pro users and server administrators can have access to this\nfeature, which allows to schedule a background job that will\nautomatically import tasks every 24 hours. This option is accessible\nfrom the \nTasks\n link in the left local navigation bar:\n\n\n\n\nTasks can be imported using any of the PYBOSSA built-in importers, such\nas csv-import and epicollect-import. To set up an autoimporter, please\nrefer to the instructions for csv-import, epicollect-import,\nflickr-import or twitter-import, as the procedure is the same:\n\n\n\n\nThe only difference is that the tasks won\nt be imported only once, but\nregularly, as explained. However, the same behaviour should be expected,\nso autoimporting a CSV file that does not change will result in no new\ntasks being imported.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe Dropbox, Amazon S3 and Youtube importers are not available for being used as an\nautoimporter.\n\n\n\n\nOnce an autoimporter has been set up, it can also be cancelled anytime.\nJust delete it. And a new one can then be created.\n\n\nDelete the project\n\n\nIn case that you want to completely remove the project and all its tasks\nand task runs, use this section to delete the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThis action cannot be undone, so be sure before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nOnly projects without results can be deleted.\n\n\n\n\nTransfer project ownership\n\n\nYou can transfer the project ownership to another user in the PYBOSSA\nserver.\n\n\nFor changing the ownership, just add the email of the user that you want\nto make the new owner.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your are not an admin of PYBOSSA you cannot undo this action, and you will\nnot be able to modify/change settings of the project as you will not\nbe the owner anymore.

            "text": "Project Tutorial\n\n\nThis tutorial is based in the demo project \nFlickr Person\n (\nsource\ncode\n) provided with\nPYBOSSA. This demo project is a simple microtasking project where users\nhave to answer the following question: \nDo you see a human face in this\nphoto?\n The possible answers are: \nYes, No\n and \nI don\nt know\n.\n\n\nThe demo project Flickr Person has two main components:\n\n\n\n\nThe task-creator a Python script that creates the tasks in\n  PYBOSSA, and\n\n\nthe task-presenter: an HTML + Javascript structure that will show\n  the tasks to the users and save their answers.\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial uses the PYBOSSA pbs command line tool.\n\n\nSetting Things Up\n\n\nIn order to run the tutorial, you will need to create an account in a\nPYBOSSA server. The PYBOSSA server could be running in your computer or\nin a third party server.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can use our Scifabric\ns free PYBOSSA server \nCrowdcrafting\n\nfor testing.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create an account, you will have access to your profile by\nclicking on your name, and then in the \nMy Settings\n option.\n\n\nThen, you will be able to copy the \nAPI-KEY that has been generated for\nyou\n\n\n\n\nThis \nAPI-KEY\n allows you to create the project in PYBOSSA (only\nauthenticated users can create projects and tasks, while everyone can\ncollaborate solving the tasks).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe Flickr Person Finder demo project uses pbs\nthat need to be installed in your system before proceeding. For this\nreason, we recommend you to configure a\n\nvirtualenv\n for the project\nas it will create an isolated Python environment in a folder,\nhelping you to manage different dependencies and versions without\nhaving to deal with root permissions in your computer.\n\n\nvirtualenv\n creates an\nenvironment that has its own installation directories, that doesn\nt\nshare libraries with other virtualenv environments (and optionally\ndoesn\nt access the globally installed libraries either).\n\n\nYou can install the software if you want at the system level if you have\nroot privileges, however this may lead to broken dependencies in the OS\nfor all your Python packages, so if possible, use only the\n\nvirtualenv\n solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFlickr Person Finder uses the \npbs\n command line tool which simplifies\na lot accessing the PYBOSSA API endpoints. Therefore, you will need to\ninstall the \npybossa-pbs\n with \npip \na python installer\npackager\n:\n\n\npip install pybossa-pbs\n\n\nIf you need to install \npip\n in your system, check \nthe official\ndocumentation.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Project\n\n\nThere are two possible methos for creating a project:\n\n\n\n\nweb-interface: click in your user name, and you will see a section\n  named \nprojects\n list. In that section you will be able to\n  create a project using the web interface.\n\n\napi-interface: using the \npbs\n command line tool.\n\n\n\n\nFor this tutorial we are going to use the second option, the ../api via\nthe PYBOSSA pbs command line tool for interacting with the API.\n\n\nFor creating the project, you will need to parameters\n\n\n\n\nthe URL of the PYBOSSA server, and\n\n\nan API-KEY to authenticate you in the PYBOSSA server.\n\n\n\n\nThe following section gives more details about how to use the script.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are running a PYBOSSA server locally, you can omit the URL parameter\nas by default it uses the URL \nhttp://localhost:5000\n\n\n\n\nCloning the Flickr Person Finder source code\n\n\nIn order to follow the tutorial, you will need to clone the \nFlickr\nPerson Finder public Github\nRepository\n so you will\nhave a local copy of the required files to create the project and tasks\nusing the API.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are new to Github and the GIT software, we recommend you to take\nthis \nfree and on-line course\n (it will take you\nonly 15 minutes!) where you will learn the basics, which are the main\nconcepts that you will need for cloning the demo project repository.\n\n\nIf you prefer to skip the course and take it in a later stage, the\ncommands that you need to clone the repository are:\n\n\n1\ngit clone git://github.com/Scifabric/app-flickrperson.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running that command a new folder named \napp-flickrperson\n will\nbe created from where you run the command.\n\n\nConfiguring the name, short name, thumbnail, etc.\n\n\nThe Flickr Person Finder provides a file called:\n\nproject.json\n\nthat has the following content:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFlickr Person Finder\n,\n\n    \nshort_name\n:\n \nflickrperson\n,\n\n    \ndescription\n:\n \nImage pattern recognition\n,\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to modify the \nname\n and \nshort_name\n fields in order\nto create a project in crowdcrafting.org, as there is already a project\nregistered with those values. Otherwise, you can keep the same values.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nname\n and \nshort_name\n of the project \nmust be unique\n!\nOtherwise you will get an error (IntegrityError) when creating the\nproject.\n\n\n\n\nYou can re-use the other fields if you want. \nDescription\n will be the\ntext shown in the project listing page. It\ns important that you try to\nhave a short description that explains what your project does.\n\n\nNow that we have the \nproject.json\n file ready, we can create the\nproject:\n\n\n1\npbs --server server --apikey key create_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will read the values in the file \nproject.json\n and it\nwill use them to create an empty project in the PYBOSSA server of your\nchoice.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can save some typing if you create a config file for pbs. Please,\ncheck the pbs page for more details.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to check if the project exists, just open your web browser,\nand type in the folling URL http://server/project/short_name\n\n\nWhere \nshort_name\n is the value of the key with the same name in the\nfile: \nproject.json\n. You sould get a project page, with not so much\ninformation, as we only have created it. Let\ns add some tasks to the\nproject.\n\n\nAdding tasks to the project\n\n\nNow that we have the project created, we can add some tasks to our\nproject. PYBOSSA will deliver the tasks for the users (authenticated and\nanonymous ones) and store the submitted answers in the PYBOSSA data\nbase, so you can process them in a later stage.\n\n\nA PYBOSSA task is a JSON object with the information that needs to be\nprocessed by the volunteers. Usually it will be a link to a media file\n(image, video, sound clip, PDF file, etc.) that needs to be processed.\n\n\nWhile PYBOSSA internally uses JSON for storing the data, you can add\ntasks to your project using two different formats:\n\n\n\n\nCSV: a comma separated spreadsheet\n\n\nJSON: a lightweight data-interchange format.\n\n\n\n\nThe demo project comes with a CSV sample file, that has the following\nstructure:\n\n\n1\n2\nquestion, url_m, link, url_b\nDo you see a human face in this photo?, http://srv/img_m.jpg, http://srv/img, http://srv/img_b.jp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally there is a script named: \nget_images.py\n that will\ncontact Flickr, get the latest published photos to this web service, and\nsave them in JSON format as a file (flickr_tasks.json), with the same\nstructure as the CSV file (the keys are the same):\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n{\n \nlink\n:\n \nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/teleyinex/2945647308/\n,\n\n  \nurl_m\n:\n \nhttp://farm4.staticflickr.com/3208/2945647308_f048cc1633_m.jpg\n,\n \n  \nurl_b\n:\n \nhttp://farm4.staticflickr.com/3208/2945647308_f048cc1633_b.jpg\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFlickr creates from the original image different cropped versions of the\nimage. It uses a pattern to distinguish them: \n_m\n for medium size,\nand \n_b\n for the big ones. There are more options, so if you need\nmore help in this matter, check the official \nFlickr\ndocumentation\n.\n\n\nAll those keys will be saved into the task field \ninfo\n of the task\nmodel.\n\n\n\n\nFrom now own, the tutorial assumes that you have configured your pbs installation \nwith a .pybossa.cfg file. Please, see \npbs for more information\n.\n\n\nAs we have a CSV file with some tasks, let\ns use it for adding some\ntasks to our project. For adding tasks in CSV format all you have to do\nis the following:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file flickr_tasks.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running this program, you will see a progress bar that will let\nyou know when all the tasks will be added to your project.\n\n\nFinally, we\nll also add some tasks in JSON format using the\n\nget_images.py\n script, that will generate for us the\n\nflickr_tasks.json\n file with the last 20 published photos in Flickr.\nFirst, we need to create the tasks file:\n\n\n1\npython get_images.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will create the file: \nflickr_tasks.json\n. Now, let\ns add them\nto our project:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file flickr_tasks.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone! Again, a progress bar will show us how long it takes to add all\nthe tasks. Once it\ns completed, we can actually move to the next step on\nthe tutorial: presenting the tasks to the volunteers.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can check all the available options for the command line with the\n\nhelp\n argument.\n\n\n\n\nIf something goes wrong, you should an error message similar to the\nfollowing one:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n    \nERROR:root:pbclient.create_project\n\n    \n{\n\n        \naction\n:\n \nPOST\n,\n\n        \nexception_cls\n:\n \nIntegrityError\n,\n\n        \nexception_msg\n:\n \n(IntegrityError) duplicate key value violates unique constraint \\\nproject_name_key\\\n\\nDETAIL:  Key (name)=(Flickr Person Finder) already exists.\\n\n,\n\n        \nstatus\n:\n \nfailed\n,\n\n        \nstatus_code\n:\n \n415\n,\n\n        \ntarget\n:\n \nproject\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe error message will have the information regarding the problems it\nhas found when using the API.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSince version 2.0.1 PYBOSSA enforces API Rate Limiting, so you might exceed\nthe number of allowed requests, getting a 429 error. Please see\nrate-limiting section.\n\n\n\n\nNumber of answers or task runs per task\n\n\nPYBOSSA by default will send a task to different users (authenticated\nand anonymous users) until 30 different task runs are obtained for each\ntask.\n\n\ntask-scheduler does not allow the same user to submit more than one\nanswer for any task (even \nanonymous\n users who are not logged in, are\nrecognised via their IP address).\n\n\nThis value, 30 answers, can be changed for each task without problems in\nthe task-redundancy section or using the API. If you want to improve the\nquality of the results for one task and get more confidence on the data\nwhen you will analyze it, you can specify it with the pbs command. For\nexample, in order to reduce the number of users that will analyze each\ntask to ten, run the following:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file file --redundancy \n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the \nn_answers\n field will make task-scheduler to try\nand obtain 10 different answers from different users for each task in\nthe file.\n\n\nChanging the Priority of the tasks\n\n\nEvery task can have its own \npriority\n. The task-priority can be\nconfigured using the web interface, or the API.\n\n\nA task with a higher priority will be delivered first to the volunteers.\nHence if you have a project where you need to analyze a task first due\nto an external event (a new data sample has been obtained), then you can\nmodify the priority of the new created task and deliver it first.\n\n\nIf you have a new batch of tasks that need to be processed before all\nthe available ones, you can do it with pbs. Run the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file file --priority \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe priority is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. The highest priority is\n1.0 and the lowest is 0.0.\n\n\nPresenting the Tasks to the user\n\n\nIn order to present the tasks to the user, you have to create an HTML\ntemplate.\n\n\nThe template is the skeleton that will be used to load the data of the\ntasks: the question, the photos, user progress, input fields \n submit\nbuttons to solve the task.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, Flickr Person uses a basic HTML skeleton and the\n\nPYBOSSA.JS\n library to load the data of the\ntasks into the HTML template, and take actions based on the users\ns\nanswers.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen a task is submitted by an authenticated user, the task will save\nhis user_id. For anonymous users the submitted task will only have\nthe user IP address.\n\n\n\n\n1. The HTML Skeleton\n\n\nThe\n\nfile\n\n\ntemplate.html\n has the skeleton to show the tasks. The file has three\nsections or \ndiv\n:\n\n\n\n\ndiv\n for the warnings actions\n. When the user saves an\n  answer, a success feedback message is shown to the user. There is\n  also an error one for the failures.\n\n\ndiv\n for the Flickr image\n. This div will be populated\n  with the task photo URL and LINK data.\n\n\ndiv\n for the Questions \n Answer buttons\n. There are\n  three buttons with the possible answers: \nYes\n, \nNo\n, and \nI don\nt\n  know\n.\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the PYBOSSA framework loads for every task the PYBOSSA.JS\nlibrary, so you don\nt have to include it in your template.\n\n\nAll you have to do is to add a script section where you will be loading\nthe tasks and saving the answers from the users:\n\nscript\n/script\n.\n\n\nThis template file will be used by the pbs command line tool to add the\ntask presenter to the project. You can add it running the following\ncommand:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can also edit the HTML skeleton using the web interface. Once the\nproject has been created in PYBOSSA you will see a button that\nallows you to edit the skeleton using a WYSIWYG editor.\n\n\n\n\nIn PYBOSSA every project has a \npresenter\n endpoint:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/SLUG/newtask\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nslug\n is the short name for the project, in this case\n\nflickrperson\n.\n\n\n\n\nLoading the above endpoint will load the skeleton and trigger the\nJavaScript functions to get a task from the PYBOSSA server and populate\nit in the HTML skeleton.\n\n\nThe header and footer for the presenter are already provided by PYBOSSA,\nso the template only has to define the structure to present the data\nfrom the tasks to the users and the action buttons, input methods, etc.\nto retrieve and save the answer from the volunteers.\n\n\n1.1. Flickr Person Skeleton\n\n\nIn the Flickr Person Finder demo we have a very simple DOM.

Loading the Task data\n\n\nNow that we have set up the \nskeleton\n to load the task data, let\ns see\nwhat JavaScript should we write to populate with the pictures from\nFlickr and how we can grab the answer of the user and save it back in\nthe server.\n\n\nAll the action takes place in the\n\nfile\n\n\ntemplate.html\n script section.\n\n\nThe script is very simple, it uses the \nPYBOSSA.JS\nlibrary\n to get a new task and to submit and\nsave the answer in the server.\n\n\nPYBOSSA.JS\n provides two methods that have\nto been overridden with some logic, as each project will have a\ndifferent need, i.e. some projects will be loading other type of data in\na different skeleton:\n\n\n\n\npybossa.taskLoaded(function(task, deferred){});\n\n\npybossa.presentTask(function(task, deferred){});\n\n\n\n\nThe \npybossa.taskLoaded\n method will be in charge of adding new\n\nimg/\n objects to the DOM once they have been loaded from\nFlickr (the URL is provided by the task object in the field\ntask.info.url_b), and resolve the deferred object, so another task for\nthe current user can be pre-loaded. The code is the following:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\npybossa\n.\ntaskLoaded\n(\nfunction\n(\ntask\n,\n \ndeferred\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\n \n!\n$\n.\nisEmptyObject\n(\ntask\n)\n \n)\n \n{\n\n        \n// load image from flickr\n\n        \nvar\n \nimg\n \n=\n \n$\n(\nimg /\n);\n\n        \nimg\n.\nload\n(\nfunction\n()\n \n{\n\n            \n// continue as soon as the image is loaded\n\n            \ndeferred\n.\nresolve\n(\ntask\n);\n\n        \n});\n\n        \nimg\n.\nattr\n(\nsrc\n,\n \ntask\n.\ninfo\n.\nurl_b\n).\ncss\n(\nheight\n,\n \n460\n);\n\n        \nimg\n.\naddClass\n(\nimg-polaroid\n);\n\n        \ntask\n.\ninfo\n.\nimage\n \n=\n \nimg\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nelse\n \n{\n\n        \ndeferred\n.\nresolve\n(\ntask\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \npybossa.presentTask\n method will be called when a task has been\nobtained from the server:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n{\n \nquestion\n:\n \nproject\n.\ndescription\n,\n\n  \ntask\n:\n \n{\n \n          \nid\n:\n \nvalue\n,\n\n          \n...,\n\n          \ninfo\n:\n \n{\n \n                  \nurl_m\n:\n \n                  \nlink\n:\n\n                 \n}\n \n        \n}\n \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat JSON object will be accessible via the task object passed as an\nargument to the pybossa.presentTask method. First we will need to check\nthat we are not getting an empty object, as it will mean that there are\nno more available tasks for the current user. In that case, we should\nhide the skeleton, and say thanks to the user as he has participated in\nall the tasks of the project.\n\n\nIf the task object is not empty, then we have task to load into the\n\nskeleton\n. In this demo project, we will basically updating the\nquestion, adding the photo to the DOM, updating the user progress and\nadd some actions to the submission buttons so we can save the answer of\nthe volunteer.\n\n\nThe PYBOSSA.JS library treats the user input as an \nasync function\n.\nThis is why the function gets a deferred object, as this object will be\n\nresolved\n when the user clicks in one of the possible answers. We use\nthis approach to load in the background the next task for the user while\nthe volunteer is solving the current one.

Saving the answer\n\n\nOnce the task has been presented, the users can click on the answer\nbuttons: \nYes\n, \nNo\n or \nI don\nt know\n.\n\n\nYes\n and \nNo\n save the answer in the DB (check \n/api/taskrun\n) with\ninformation about the task and the answer, while the button \nI don\nt\nknow\n simply loads another task as sometimes the image is not available\n(the Flickr user has delete it) or it is not clear if there is a human\nor not in the image (you only see one hand and nothing else).\n\n\nIn order to submit and save the answer from the user, we will use again\nthe \nPYBOSSA.JS library\n. In this case:\n\n\n1\npybossa\n.\nsaveTask\n(\n \ntaskid\n,\n \nanswer\n \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \npybossa.saveTask\n method saves an answer for a given task. In the\nprevious section we show that in the pybossa.presentTask method the\n\ntask-id\n can be obtained, as we will be passing the object to saveTask\nmethod.\n\n\nThe method allows us to give a successful pop-up feedback for the user,\nso you can use the following structure to warn the user and tell him\nthat his answer has been successfully saved:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\npybossa\n.\nsaveTask\n(\n \ntaskid\n,\n \nanswer\n \n).\ndone\n(\n\n  \nfunction\n(\n \ndata\n \n)\n \n{\n\n      \n// Show the feedback div\n\n      \n$\n(\n#success\n).\nfadeIn\n();\n \n      \n// Fade out the pop-up after a 1000 miliseconds\n\n      \nsetTimeout\n(\nfunction\n()\n \n{\n \n$\n(\n#success\n).\nfadeOut\n()\n \n},\n \n1000\n);\n\n  \n};\n\n\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Updating the template for all the tasks\n\n\nIt is possible to update the template of the project without having to\nre-create the project and its tasks. In order to update the template,\nyou only have to modify the file \ntemplate.html\n and run the following\ncommand:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the web interface to do it, and see the changes in real\ntime before saving the results. Check your project page, go to the tasks\nsection, and look for the \nEdit the task presenter\n button.\n\n\n5. Test the task presenter\n\n\nIn order to test the project task presenter, go to the following URL:\n\n\n1\nhttp://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/SLUG/presenter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presenter will load one task, and you will be able to submit and\nsave one answer for the current task.\n\n\nPublishing the project\n\n\nOnce everything is working, you will need to publish the project so\npeople can start contributing to it. Please, check the publishing\nsection for more details.\n\n\nCreating a tutorial for the users\n\n\nIn general, users will like to have some feedback when accessing for the\nvery first time your project. Usually, the overview page of your project\nwill not be enough, so you can actually build a tutorial (a web page)\nthat will explain to the volunteer how he can participate in the\nproject.\n\n\nPYBOSSA will detect if the user is accessing for the very first time\nyour project, so in that case, it will load the \ntutorial\n if your\nproject has one.\n\n\nAdding a tutorial is really simple: you only have to create a file named\n\ntutorial.html\n and load the content of the file using pbs:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tutorial could have whatever you like: videos, nice animations, etc.\nPYBOSSA will render for you the header and the footer, so you only have\nto focus on the content. You can actually copy the template.html file\nand use it as a draft of your tutorial or just include a video of\nyourself explaining why your project is important and how, as a\nvolunteer, you can contribute.\n\n\nIf your project has a tutorial, you can actually access it directly in\nthis endpoint:\n\n\n1\nhttp://server/project/tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding an advance tutorial\n\n\nWhile the previous solution works for most of the projects, your project\nmight need something special: visual clues so users can easily identify\nsounds, patterns, etc. easily. The default tutorial does not allow you\nto curate/create a list of helping materials that could be used directly\nin the presenter to explain how for example you can identify cancer\ncells, or specific species of animals.\n\n\nFor this reason PYBOSSA now suppports an API endpoint for helping\nmaterials: api/helpingmaterial\n\n\nThis endpoint allows you to add JSON and media files (images, videos or\nsounds) that you can use with your project to build an interactive\ntutorial.\n\n\nAs with any \napi\n PYBOSSA endpoint it follows the same rules. However,\nyou can use it for uploading images via the endpoint using the\nmultipart/form-data Content-Type.\n\n\nFor example, imagine that you want to add a photo of an animal and it\ns\ndescription, so users can easily identify it (or use it as pre-loaded\nanswer for classifying pictures of animals). In this case, you can do\nthe following (using the popular Python requests library, but you can\nuse any other programming language):\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\nimport\n \nrequests\n\n\nurl\n \n=\n \nhttps://server/api/helpingpoint?api_key=YOURKEY\n\n\n# Upload a picture\n\n\nfiles\n \n=\n \n{\nfile\n:\n \nopen\n(\ntest.jpg\n,\n \nrb\n)}\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \n{\nproject_id\n:\n \nYOURPROJECT_ID\n}\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrequests\n.\npost\n(\nurl\n,\n \ndata\n=\ndata\n,\n \nfiles\n=\nfiles\n)\n\n\n# Get the created helping material\n\n\nhp\n \n=\n \nr\n.\njson\n()\n\n\n# Add the meta-data of the picture\n\n\nurl\n \n=\n \nhttps://server/api/helpingpoint/\n%s\n?api_key=YOURKEY\n \n%\n \nhp\n[\nid\n]\n\n\ninfo\n \n=\n \n{\npopular_name\n:\n \nelephant\n,\n \nscientific_name\n:\n \nloxodonta\n}\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrequests\n.\nput\n(\nurl\n,\n \njson\n=\n{\ninfo\n:\n \ninfo\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add as many files as you want. Then, from any place you can\nquery the helping material endpoint to retrieve the example/tutorial\nmaterials for helping your users.\n\n\nProviding some I18n support\n\n\nSometimes, you may want to give the users of your project a little help\nand present them the tutorial and tasks in their language. To allow\nthis, you can access their locale via Javascript in a very easy way, as\nwe\nve placed it in a hidden \ndiv\n node so you can access it just like\nthis:\n\n\n1\nvar\n \nuserLocale\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementById\n(\nPYBOSSA_USER_LOCALE\n).\ntextContent\n.\ntrim\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way you use it after that is up to you. But let\ns see an example of\nhow you can use it to make a tutorial that automatically shows the\nstrings in the locale of the user.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAnonymous users will be only shown with \nen\n language by default. This\nfeature only works for authenticated users that choose their own\nlocale in their account. You can however, load the translated\nstrings using the browser preferred language.\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, check the \ntutorial.html file\n. You will see it consists\non some HTML plus some Javascript inside a \nscript\n tag to handle\nthe different steps of the tutorial. Here you have a snippet of HTML\ntutorial file:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\ndiv\n \nclass\n=\nrow\n\n    \ndiv\n \nclass\n=\ncol-md-12\n\n        \ndiv\n \nid\n=\nmodal\n \nclass\n=\nmodal hide fade\n\n            \ndiv\n \nclass\n=\nmodal-header\n\n                \nh3\nFlickr Person Finder tutorial\n/\nh3\n\n            \n/\ndiv\n\n            \ndiv\n \nid\n=\n0\n \nclass\n=\nmodal-body\n \nstyle\n=\ndisplay:none\n\n                \np\nstrong\nHi!\n/\nstrong\n This is a \nstrong\ndemo project\n/\nstrong\n that shows how you can do pattern recognition on pictures or images using the PYBOSSA framework in Crowdcrafting.org.\n               \n/\np\n\n            \n/\ndiv\n\n            \ndiv\n \nid\n=\n1\n \nclass\n=\nmodal-body\n \nstyle\n=\ndisplay:none\n\n                \np\nThe project is really simple.

The rest of the\nscript will only compare the locale of the user that is seeing the\ntutorial and delete all the HTML that is not in his language, so that\nonly the tutorial that fits his locale settings is shown.\n\n\nAnother method to support I18n\n\n\nAnother option for translating your project to different languages is\nusing a JSON object like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nmessages\n \n=\n \n{\nen\n:\n \n               \n{\nwelcome\n:\n \nHello World!,\n\n\n                \nbye\n: \nGood\n \nbye\n!\n\n\n               },\n\n\n            \nes\n:\n\n               \n{\nwelcome\n:\n \nHola mundo!\n,\n\n                \nbye\n:\n \nHasta luego!\n\n               \n}\n\n           \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis object can be placed in the \ntutorial.html\n or \ntemplate.html\n file\nto load the proper strings translated to your users.\n\n\nThe logic is very simple. With the following code you grab the language\nthat should be loaded for the current user:\n\n\n1\nvar\n \nuserLocale\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementById\n(\nPYBOSSA_USER_LOCALE\n).\ntextContent\n.\ntrim\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, use userLocale to load the strings. For example, for\n\ntemplate.html\n and the Flickrperson demo project, you will find the\nfollowing code at the start of the script:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n// Default language\n\n\nvar\n \nuserLocale\n \n=\n \nen\n;\n\n\n// Translations\n\n\nvar\n \nmessages\n \n=\n \n{\nen\n:\n \n{\n\n                        \ni18n_welldone\n:\n \nWell done!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_welldone_text\n:\n \nYour answer has been saved\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_loading_next_task\n:\n \nLoading next task...\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_task_completed\n:\n \nThe task has been completed!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_thanks\n:\n \nThanks a lot!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_congratulations\n:\n \nCongratulations\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_congratulations_text\n:\n \nYou have participated in all available tasks!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_yes\n:\n \nYes\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_no_photo\n:\n \nNo photo\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_i_dont_know\n:\n \nI don\nt know\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_working_task\n:\n \nYou are working now on task:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_tasks_completed\n:\n \nYou have completed:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_tasks_from\n:\n \ntasks from\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_show_comments\n:\n \nShow comments:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_hide_comments\n:\n \nHide comments:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_question\n:\n \nDo you see a human face in this photo?\n,\n\n                      \n},\n\n                \nes\n:\n \n{\n\n                        \ni18n_welldone\n:\n \nBien hecho!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_welldone_text\n:\n \nTu respuesta ha sido guardada\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_loading_next_task\n:\n \nCargando la siguiente tarea...\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_task_completed\n:\n \nLa tarea ha sido completadas!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_thanks\n:\n \nMuch\u00edsimas gracias!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_congratulations\n:\n \nEnhorabuena\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_congratulations_text\n:\n \nHas participado en todas las tareas disponibles!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_yes\n:\n \nS\u00ed\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_no_photo\n:\n \nNo hay foto\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_i_dont_know\n:\n \nNo lo s\u00e9\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_working_task\n:\n \nEst\u00e1s trabajando en la tarea:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_tasks_completed\n:\n \nHas completado:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_tasks_from\n:\n \ntareas de\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_show_comments\n:\n \nMostrar comentarios\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_hide_comments\n:\n \nOcultar comentarios\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_question\n:\n \n\u00bfVes una cara humana en esta foto?\n,\n\n                      \n},\n\n               \n};\n\n\n// Update userLocale with server side information\n\n \n$\n(\ndocument\n).\nready\n(\nfunction\n(){\n\n     \nuserLocale\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementById\n(\nPYBOSSA_USER_LOCALE\n).\ntextContent\n.\ntrim\n();\n\n\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ni18n_translate\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nids\n \n=\n \nObject\n.\nkeys\n(\nmessages\n[\nuserLocale\n])\n\n    \nfor\n \n(\ni\n=\n0\n;\n \ni\nids\n.\nlength\n;\n \ni\n++\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nconsole\n.\nlog\n(\nTranslating: \n \n+\n \nids\n[\ni\n]);\n\n        \ndocument\n.\ngetElementById\n(\nids\n[\ni\n]).\ninnerHTML\n \n=\n \nmessages\n[\nuserLocale\n][\nids\n[\ni\n]];\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we define the default locale, \nen\n for English. Then, we create a\nmessages dictionary with all the ids that we want to translate. Finally,\nwe add the languages that we want to support.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA will give you only the following 3 locale settings: \nen\n, \nes\n\nand \nfr\n as PYBOSSA is only translated to those languages. If you want\nto add another language, please, help us to translate PYBOSSA (see\ntranslating).\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it\ns quite simple as you can share the messages object\nwith your volunteers, so you can get many more translations for your\nproject easily.\n\n\nFinally, we need to actually load those translated strings into the\ntemplate. For doing this step, all we\nve to do is adding the following\ncode to our \ntemplate.html\n file at the function pybossa.presentTask:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\npybossa\n.\npresentTask\n(\nfunction\n(\ntask\n,\n \ndeferred\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\n \n!\n$\n.\nisEmptyObject\n(\ntask\n)\n \n)\n \n{\n\n        \nloadUserProgress\n();\n\n        \ni18n_translate\n();\n\n        \n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone! When the task is loaded, the strings are translated and the\nproject will be shown in the user language.\n\n\nProviding more details about the project\n\n\nUp to now we have created the project, added some tasks, but the project\nstill lacks a lot of information. For example, a welcome page (or long\ndescription) of the project, so the users can know what this project is\nabout.\n\n\nIf you check the source code, you will see that there is a file named\n\nlong_description.md\n. This file has a long description of the project,\nexplaining different aspects of it.\n\n\nThis information is not mandatory, however it will be very useful for\nthe users as they will get a bit more of information about the project\ngoals.\n\n\nThe file can be composed using Markdown or plain text.\n\n\nThe long description will be shown in the project home page:\n\n\n1\nhttp://crowdcrafting.org/project/flickrperson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to modify the description you have two options, edit it via\nthe web interface, or modify locally the \nlong_description.md\n file and\nrun pbs to update it:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding an icon to the project\n\n\nIt is possible also to add a nice icon for the project. By default\nPYBOSSA will render a 100x100 pixels empty thumbnail for those projects\nthat do not provide it.\n\n\nIf you want to add an icon you can do it by using the web interface.\nJust go to the \nSettings\n tab within your project. There, select the\nimage file you want to use and push the \nUpload\n button. That\ns all!\n\n\nProtecting the project with a password\n\n\nIf, for any reason, you want to allow only certain people to contribute\nto your project, you can set a password. Thus, every time a user (either\nanonymous or authenticated) wants to contribute to the project, it will\nbe asked to introduce the password. The user will then be able to\ncontribute to the project for 30 minutes (this is a value by default,\ncan be changed in every PYBOSSA server). After this time, the user will\nbe asked again to introduce the password if wants to continue\ncontributing, and so on.\n\n\nCreating a blog for the project\n\n\nYou can share the progress of the project creating a blog. Every PYBOSSA\nproject includes a very simple blog where you will be able to write\nabout your project regularly.\n\n\nYou can use Markdown or plain text for the content of the posts. And you\nwill also be able to edit them or delete after creation if you want.\n\n\nTo write a post simply go to the project \nSettings tab and there you\nwill find an option to write, read or delete your blog posts\n.\n\n\nYou can use the endpoint /api/blogpost to add also blogposts, update\nthem and delete them. The api endpoint allows you as well to upload a\npicture to your blogpost.\n\n\nThis endpoint allows you to add JSON and media files (images, videos or\nsounds) that you can use with your blogpost.\n\n\nAs with any \napi\n PYBOSSA endpoint it follows the same rules. However,\nyou can use it for uploading images via the endpoint using the\nmultipart/form-data Content-Type.\n\n\nFor example, imagine that you want to add a photo as a cover and then\nthe body of the blogpost. In this case, you can do the following (using\nthe popular Python requests library, but you can use any other\nprogramming language):\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\nimport\n \nrequests\n\n\nurl\n \n=\n \nhttps://server/api/blogpost?api_key=YOURKEY\n\n\n# Upload a picture\n\n\nfiles\n \n=\n \n{\nfile\n:\n \nopen\n(\ntest.jpg\n,\n \nrb\n)}\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \n{\nproject_id\n:\n \nYOURPROJECT_ID\n,\n \ntitle\n=\ntitle\n,\n \nbody\n=\nbody\n}\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrequests\n.\npost\n(\nurl\n,\n \ndata\n=\ndata\n,\n \nfiles\n=\nfiles\n)\n\n\n# Get the created blogpost\n\n\nbp\n \n=\n \nr\n.\njson\n()\n\n\n# Update the body with the meta-data of the picture\n\n\nurl\n \n=\n \nhttps://server/api/blogpost/\n%s\n?api_key=YOURKEY\n \n%\n \nbp\n[\nid\n]\n\n\nbody\n \n=\n \nhello ![img](\n%s\n)\n \n%\n \nbp\n[\nmedia_url\n]\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrequests\n.\nput\n(\nurl\n,\n \njson\n=\n{\nbody\n:\n \nbody\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExporting the obtained results\n\n\nYou can export all the available tasks and task runs for your project in\nthree different ways:\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n, an open standard designed\n    for human-readable data interchange, or\n\n\nCSV\n, a file\n    that stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form and\n    that can be opened with almost any spreadsheet software, or\n\n\nCKAN\n web server, a powerful data management\n    system that makes data accessible \u2013by providing tools to streamline\n    publishing, sharing, finding and using data.\n\n\n\n\nFor exporting the data, all you have to do is to visit the following URL\nin your web-browser:\n\n\n1\nhttp://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/slug/tasks/export\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will find a simple interface that will allow you to export the Tasks\nand Task Runs to \nJSON\n and\n\nCSV\n formats:\n\n\n\n\nThe previous methods will export all the tasks and task runs, \neven if\nthey are not completed\n. When a task has been completed, in other\nwords, when a task has collected the number of answers specified by the\ntask (\nn_answers\n = 30 by default), a \nbrown button\n with the text\n\nDownload results\n will pop up, and if you click it all the answers\nfor the given task will be shown in JSON format.\n\n\nYou can check which tasks are completed, going to the project URL:\n\n\n1\nhttp://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/slug\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd clicking in the \nTasks\n link in the \nleft local navigation\n, and\nthen click in the \nBrowse\n box:\n\n\n\n\nThen you will see which tasks are completed, and which ones you can\ndownload in \nJSON\n format:\n\n\n\n\nYou could download the results also using the API. For example, you\ncould write a small script that gets the list of tasks that have been\ncompleted using this url:\n\n\n1\nGET http://PYBOSSA-SERVER/api/task?state=completed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your project has more than 20 tasks, then you will need to use the\n\noffset\n and \nlimit\n parameters to get the next tasks, as by\ndefault PYBOSSA API only returns the first 20 items.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have obtained the list of completed tasks, your script could\nstart requesting the collected answers for the given tasks:\n\n\n1\nGET http://PYBOSSA-SERVER/api/taskrun?task_id=TASK-ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your project is collecting more than 20 answers per task, then you\nwill need to use the \noffset\n and \nlimit\n parameters to get the next\ntask runs, as by default PYBOSSA API only returns the first 20 items.\nThat way you will be able to get all the submitted answers by the\nvolunteers for the given task.\n\n\n\n\nExporting the task and task runs in JSON\n\n\nFor the \nJSON\n format, you will get\nall the output as a file that your browser will download, named:\nshort_name_tasks.json for the tasks, and short_name_task_runs.json\nfor the task runs.\n\n\nExporting the task and task runs to a CSV file\n\n\nWhile for the \nCSV\n\nformat, you will get a CSV file that will be automatically saved in your\ncomputer.\n\n\nExporting the task and task runs to a CKAN server\n\n\nIf the server has been configured to allow you to export your\naplication\ns data to a CKAN server (see config-ckan), the owner of the\nproject will see another box that will give you the option to export the\ndata to the CKAN server.\n\n\nIn order to use this method you will need to add the CKAN API-KEY\nassociated with your account, otherwise you will not be able to export\nthe data and a warning message will let you know it.\n\n\nAdding the CKAN API-KEY is really simple. You only need to create an\naccount in the supported CKAN server, check your profile and copy the\nAPI-KEY. Then, open your PYBOSSA account page, edit it and paste the key\nin the section \nExternal Services\n.\n\n\n\n\nThen, you will be able to actually export the data to the CKAN server\nand host it there.\n\n\nPublishing results of your project\n\n\nSince v1.2.0, PYBOSSA automatically creates \nempty\n results when a task\nis completed.\n\n\nFor example, imagine your project is asking the following question in a\nset of images: \nDo you see a triangle in this picture?\n The possible\nanswers are: yes and no.\n\n\nYour project has configured the task redundancy to 5, so 5 people will\nanswer that question for a given image (or task). When the 5\nth\n person\nsends the answer, the server marks the task as completed, and it creates\na result for the given task associating the answers, the task and the\nproject:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{\nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \nproject_id\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \ntask_id\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \ntask_run_ids\n:\n \n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n],\n\n \ninfo\n:\n \nnull\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in other PYBOSSA domain objects, a result has a JSON field named\n\ninfo\n that allows you to store the \nfinal result\n for that task\nusing the task_runs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Imagine that the five volunteers\nanswered: yes, then as you are the project owner you could update the\ninfo field with that value:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{\nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \nproject_id\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \ntask_id\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \ntask_run_ids\n:\n \n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n],\n\n \ninfo\n:\n \n{\ntriangle\n:\n \nyes\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benefit of storing that information is that you can access these\ndata via the PYBOSSA API so you will be able to show the results, in\nyour result project section using the API.\n\n\nThis will allow you to build beautiful visualizations of your results on\nmaps, webgl, etc.\n\n\nRight now this new feature is evolving, so please contact us if you need\nhelp. We\nll provide result templates soon for our own basic templates.\n\n\nKeeping track of the time spent by volunteers\n\n\nSince v1.1.3, PYBOSSA records a timestamp, for every task run, of the\ninstant a volunteer requests a task to contribute to it. This is stored\nin the \ncreated\n attribute of the Task Runs.\n\n\nThis allows, together with the \nfinish_time\n attribute, to know how\nmuch time the volunteer has spent completing the task: (time spent =\nfinish_time - created)",

You can install the software if you want at the system level if you have\nroot privileges, however this may lead to broken dependencies in the OS\nfor all your Python packages, so if possible, use only the virtualenv  solution.

PYBOSSA will deliver the tasks for the users (authenticated and\nanonymous ones) and store the submitted answers in the PYBOSSA data\nbase, so you can process them in a later stage.  A PYBOSSA task is a JSON object with the information that needs to be\nprocessed by the volunteers. Usually it will be a link to a media file\n(image, video, sound clip, PDF file, etc.) that needs to be processed.  While PYBOSSA internally uses JSON for storing the data, you can add\ntasks to your project using two different formats:   CSV: a comma separated spreadsheet  JSON: a lightweight data-interchange format.   The demo project comes with a CSV sample file, that has the following\nstructure:  1\n2 question, url_m, link, url_b\nDo you see a human face in this photo?, http://srv/img_m.jpg, http://srv/img, http://srv/img_b.jp   Additionally there is a script named:  get_images.py  that will\ncontact Flickr, get the latest published photos to this web service, and\nsave them in JSON format as a file (flickr_tasks.json), with the same\nstructure as the CSV file (the keys are the same):  1\n2\n3 {   link :   http://www.flickr.com/photos/teleyinex/2945647308/ , \n   url_m :   http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3208/2945647308_f048cc1633_m.jpg ,  \n   url_b :   http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3208/2945647308_f048cc1633_b.jpg   }     Note  Flickr creates from the original image different cropped versions of the\nimage. It uses a pattern to distinguish them:  _m  for medium size,\nand  _b  for the big ones. There are more options, so if you need\nmore help in this matter, check the official  Flickr\ndocumentation .  All those keys will be saved into the task field  info  of the task\nmodel.   From now own, the tutorial assumes that you have configured your pbs installation \nwith a .pybossa.cfg file. Please, see  pbs for more information .  As we have a CSV file with some tasks, let s use it for adding some\ntasks to our project. For adding tasks in CSV format all you have to do\nis the following:  1 pbs add_tasks --tasks-file flickr_tasks.csv   After running this program, you will see a progress bar that will let\nyou know when all the tasks will be added to your project.  Finally, we ll also add some tasks in JSON format using the get_images.py  script, that will generate for us the flickr_tasks.json  file with the last 20 published photos in Flickr.\nFirst, we need to create the tasks file:  1 python get_images.py   This will create the file:  flickr_tasks.json . Now, let s add them\nto our project:  1 pbs add_tasks --tasks-file flickr_tasks.json   Done! Again, a progress bar will show us how long it takes to add all\nthe tasks. Once it s completed, we can actually move to the next step on\nthe tutorial: presenting the tasks to the volunteers.

            "text": "Now that we have set up the  skeleton  to load the task data, let s see\nwhat JavaScript should we write to populate with the pictures from\nFlickr and how we can grab the answer of the user and save it back in\nthe server.  All the action takes place in the file  template.html  script section.  The script is very simple, it uses the  PYBOSSA.JS\nlibrary  to get a new task and to submit and\nsave the answer in the server.  PYBOSSA.JS  provides two methods that have\nto been overridden with some logic, as each project will have a\ndifferent need, i.e. some projects will be loading other type of data in\na different skeleton:   pybossa.taskLoaded(function(task, deferred){});  pybossa.presentTask(function(task, deferred){});   The  pybossa.taskLoaded  method will be in charge of adding new img/  objects to the DOM once they have been loaded from\nFlickr (the URL is provided by the task object in the field\ntask.info.url_b), and resolve the deferred object, so another task for\nthe current user can be pre-loaded. The code is the following:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16 pybossa . taskLoaded ( function ( task ,   deferred )   { \n     if   (   ! $ . isEmptyObject ( task )   )   { \n         // load image from flickr \n         var   img   =   $ ( img / ); \n         img . load ( function ()   { \n             // continue as soon as the image is loaded \n             deferred . resolve ( task ); \n         }); \n         img . attr ( src ,   task . info . url_b ). css ( height ,   460 ); \n         img . addClass ( img-polaroid ); \n         task . info . image   =   img ; \n     } \n     else   { \n         deferred . resolve ( task ); \n     }  });    The  pybossa.presentTask  method will be called when a task has been\nobtained from the server:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10 {   question :   project . description , \n   task :   {  \n           id :   value , \n           ..., \n           info :   {  \n                   url_m :  \n                   link : \n                  }  \n         }   }    That JSON object will be accessible via the task object passed as an\nargument to the pybossa.presentTask method. First we will need to check\nthat we are not getting an empty object, as it will mean that there are\nno more available tasks for the current user. In that case, we should\nhide the skeleton, and say thanks to the user as he has participated in\nall the tasks of the project.  If the task object is not empty, then we have task to load into the skeleton . In this demo project, we will basically updating the\nquestion, adding the photo to the DOM, updating the user progress and\nadd some actions to the submission buttons so we can save the answer of\nthe volunteer.  The PYBOSSA.JS library treats the user input as an  async function .\nThis is why the function gets a deferred object, as this object will be resolved  when the user clicks in one of the possible answers. We use\nthis approach to load in the background the next task for the user while\nthe volunteer is solving the current one. Once the answer has been saved\nin the server, we resolve the deferred:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32 pybossa . presentTask ( function ( task ,   deferred )   { \n     if   (   ! $ . isEmptyObject ( task )   )   { \n         loadUserProgress (); \n         $ ( #photo-link ). html ( ). append ( task . info . image ); \n         $ ( #photo-link ). attr ( href ,   task . info . link ); \n         $ ( #question ). html ( task . info . question ); \n         $ ( #task-id ). html ( task . id ); \n         $ ( .btn-answer ). off ( click ). on ( click ,   function ( evt )   { \n             var   answer   =   $ ( evt . target ). attr ( value ); \n             if   ( typeof   answer   !=   undefined )   { \n                 //console.log(answer); \n                 pybossa . saveTask ( task . id ,   answer ). done ( function ()   { \n                     deferred . resolve (); \n                 }); \n                 $ ( #loading ). fadeIn ( 500 ); \n                 if   ( $ ( #disqus_thread ). is ( :visible ))   { \n                     $ ( #disqus_thread ). toggle (); \n                     $ ( .btn-disqus ). toggle (); \n                 } \n             } \n             else   { \n                 $ ( #error ). show (); \n             } \n         }); \n         $ ( #loading ). hide (); \n     } \n     else   { \n         $ ( .skeleton ). hide (); \n         $ ( #loading ). hide (); \n         $ ( #finish ). fadeIn ( 500 ); \n     }  });    It is important to note that in this method we bind the  on-click \naction for the  Yes ,  No  and  I don t know  buttons to call the above\nsnippet:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17 $ ( .btn-answer ). off ( click ). on ( click ,   function ( evt )   { \n     var   answer   =   $ ( evt . target ). attr ( value ); \n     if   ( typeof   answer   !=   undefined )   { \n         //console.log(answer); \n         pybossa . saveTask ( task . id ,   answer ). done ( function ()   { \n             deferred . resolve (); \n         }); \n         $ ( #loading ). fadeIn ( 500 ); \n         if   ( $ ( #disqus_thread ). is ( :visible ))   { \n             $ ( #disqus_thread ). toggle (); \n             $ ( .btn-disqus ). toggle (); \n         } \n     } \n     else   { \n         $ ( #error ). show (); \n     }  });    If your project uses other input methods, you will have to adapt this to\nfit your project needs.  Finally, the pybossa.presentTask calls a method named loadUserProgress . This method is in charge of getting the user\nprogress of the user and update the progress bar accordingly:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10 function   loadUserProgress ()   { \n     pybossa . userProgress ( flickrperson ). done ( function ( data ){ \n         var   pct   =   Math . round (( data . done * 100 ) / data . total ); \n         $ ( #progress ). css ( width ,   pct . toString ()   + % ); \n         $ ( #progress ). attr ( title ,   pct . toString ()   +   % completed! ); \n         $ ( #progress ). tooltip ({ placement :   left });  \n         $ ( #total ). text ( data . total ); \n         $ ( #done ). text ( data . done ); \n     });  }    You can update the code to only show the number of answers, or remove it\ncompletely, however the volunteers will benefit from this type of\ninformation as they will be able to know how many tasks they have to do,\ngiving an idea of progress while the contribute to the project.  Finally, we only need in our code to tell pybossa.js to run our project:  1 pybossa . run ( flickrperson )",

In order to submit and save the answer from the user, we will use again\nthe  PYBOSSA.JS library . In this case:  1 pybossa . saveTask (   taskid ,   answer   )    The  pybossa.saveTask  method saves an answer for a given task. In the\nprevious section we show that in the pybossa.presentTask method the task-id  can be obtained, as we will be passing the object to saveTask\nmethod.

PYBOSSA will detect if the user is accessing for the very first time\nyour project, so in that case, it will load the  tutorial  if your\nproject has one.

The default tutorial does not allow you\nto curate/create a list of helping materials that could be used directly\nin the presenter to explain how for example you can identify cancer\ncells, or specific species of animals.  For this reason PYBOSSA now suppports an API endpoint for helping\nmaterials: api/helpingmaterial  This endpoint allows you to add JSON and media files (images, videos or\nsounds) that you can use with your project to build an interactive\ntutorial.  As with any  api  PYBOSSA endpoint it follows the same rules. However,\nyou can use it for uploading images via the endpoint using the\nmultipart/form-data Content-Type.

Then, we create a\nmessages dictionary with all the ids that we want to translate. Finally,\nwe add the languages that we want to support.   Note  PYBOSSA will give you only the following 3 locale settings:  en ,  es \nand  fr  as PYBOSSA is only translated to those languages. If you want\nto add another language, please, help us to translate PYBOSSA (see\ntranslating).   As you can see, it s quite simple as you can share the messages object\nwith your volunteers, so you can get many more translations for your\nproject easily.  Finally, we need to actually load those translated strings into the\ntemplate. For doing this step, all we ve to do is adding the following\ncode to our  template.html  file at the function pybossa.presentTask:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5 pybossa . presentTask ( function ( task ,   deferred )   { \n     if   (   ! $ . isEmptyObject ( task )   )   { \n         loadUserProgress (); \n         i18n_translate (); \n         ...    Done! When the task is loaded, the strings are translated and the\nproject will be shown in the user language.",

Your project has configured the task redundancy to 5, so 5 people will\nanswer that question for a given image (or task).

This will allow you to build beautiful visualizations of your results on\nmaps, webgl, etc.  Right now this new feature is evolving, so please contact us if you need\nhelp. We ll provide result templates soon for our own basic templates.",
